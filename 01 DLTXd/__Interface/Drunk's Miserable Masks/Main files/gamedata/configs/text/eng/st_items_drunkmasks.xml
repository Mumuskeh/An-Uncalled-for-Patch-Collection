		<text>A Soviet surplus ShMB gas mask refitted with external 40mm filters for greater functionality. This particular variant has been re-tooled for various faction's recruits in more dangerous areas of the Zone. As such, it offers a better field of view and a higher level of protection from radioactive hazards compared to its predecessor, while still maintaining a fair price.\n \n

	<string id="st_helm_hardhat_snag_descr">
		<text>An upgraded steel army helmet and respirator combo. This variant was made and used exclusively by the Clear Sky faction in the early 2010s. Personally developed by Nimble, this rare dual-filter mask offers greatly increased chemical protection and field of view compared to most other helmet / respirator mask combos, but in return it offers slightly less protection against thermal and ballistic threats.
