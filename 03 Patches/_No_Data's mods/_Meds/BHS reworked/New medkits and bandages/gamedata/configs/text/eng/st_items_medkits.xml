		<text>An improved version of the military medkits sometimes issued to the veteran combatants of the USS, Spetsnaz and Duty and despite not being Ukrainian-made, these medkits have somehow found their way into the hands of the Mercenaries. This medkit, in addition to everything the army medkits have, also has substances that react as soon as they enter the user's bloodstream, which can help save the user's life when used in critical situations where they would normally bleed out by the time the effects of the medkit kick in. Among those substances is a drug that helps neutralize the effects of alcohol and other nausea-inducing drugs. These medkits have not been in circulation for long and are harder to come across than typical medkits, making them fairly valuable.\n \n
