	<string id="st_tramadol_descr">
		<text>Tramadol is a powerful painkiller, highly effective for treating moderate to severe pain. Unlike syringes, which require precise administration and can trigger needle phobia, tramadol pills are easy to use and more accessible for many stalkers. This convenience makes tramadol a preferred choice over other potent painkillers like metamizole or morphine. Because it's difficult to obtain outside the Zone due to its prescription-only status thanks to its addictive properties, tramadol is quite expensive within the Zone.\n \n
