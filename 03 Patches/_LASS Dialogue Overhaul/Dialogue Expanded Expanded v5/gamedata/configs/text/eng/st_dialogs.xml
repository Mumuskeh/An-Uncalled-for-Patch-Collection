		<text>Well, I heard a funny story once. Basically, the boys at Garbage started a rumour about where the Oasis is, and made it real believable, too. Then, they went to that location and waited. Well, what can I say? So many gullible losers showed up to share their stuff that the boys who started the whole thing left the Zone soon afterwards. And why not? Fellas were set for life. Only one of them stayed behind, some guy called Yoga...</text>

	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_113">
		<text>Why would I bother listening to that crap? All it is, is cheap talk for losers... Real men don't believe that shit. You know, you're sitting in a bar with a cold one in your hand and the stalkers are buzzing all around, arguing over where the Oasis is. And every one of those suckers swears he knows the location...

	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_172">

	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_43">
		<text>Hey buddy, do I look like a guide or what? I mean, is there a tattoo on my forehead that says 'Ask stupid questions here' or something? Go ask Pilot, he's paid to answer questions about that shit.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_44">
		<text>No... What would I do there anyways? There ain't no stalkers to rip off there!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_5">
		<text>Can you suggest anyone that's not too tied down who'd be willing to make a move for Pripyat?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_51">
		<text>Pripyat ain't no place for guys like us. Think about it, it's full of mutants and anomalies... like the rest of the Zone... but without stalkers and their loot. When stalkers show up in Pripyat, give us a shout and we'll head on over there to maintain the natural order of things.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_57">
		<text>No idea, buddy. Sorry.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_6">
		<text>I found an unusual shooter. Do you know anyone who might know something about it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_62">
		<text>Well, I'd ask the technicians. I mean, it's their business to know this shit, right?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_63">
		<text>Beats me, but stalkers from Skadovsk believe that Cardan is a technical genius or something. Talk to him if you want... He's just an old drunk if you ask me...</text>

	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_7">
		<text>Who could I hire to take measurements for the scientists?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_73">
		<text>That's an easy one - our boys will do it. I mean they didn't go to school or anything, but they'll take whoever you want and measure them real good. Once they have the measurements, all they need is a nice grave and that's no problem either!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_8">
		<text>I found a very strange artefact. Can you suggest a buyer?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_81">
		<text>A strange artefact, you say? Let's have a look at it... Hand it over so I can see it better... Hah, relax buddy - I'm just kidding, but if I were you I'd keep that kind of thing out of sight. Others might not have such a good sense of humour.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_83">
		<text>You've got balls to be flashing that artefact around here. Respect. Here's the thing: the man to see for that shit is Beard over at Skadovsk. We don't know how he's getting the artefacts out of the Zone yet, so you should be able to sell yours no problem.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_1">
		<text>Like what?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_10">
		<text>What do you think about Nimble?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_101">
		<text>Nimble? Never heard of him. Maybe he's in another squad or something?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_11">
		<text>You hear anything about the Oasis?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_111">
		<text>It's a stalker fairytale. That's what stalkers do: make up shit that ain't true and then all get together and search for it! I'd ignore that stuff if I were you. It's like a gateway myth: believe it and you'll believe that the Wish Granter exists before long.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_112">
		<text>Ah, that place where wounds heal by themselves and your energy is magically replenished? I got news for you, friend: it doesn't exist. Stalkers invent that crap to make the Zone sound less dangerous than it is, but the harsh reality is that there are no safe places in the Zone. And you gotta keep a firm grasp on that reality out here, buddy - dreamer types don't last long in the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_113">
		<text>Yeah, and all the artefacts there are worth their weight in gold and are presented to you on a silver platter while you're getting your feet rubbed... I'm joking, of course. I doubt it exists, although it would be nice if it did. We could even set up a hospital there without the need for any medics - folks could just show up there and heal... Damn, what a pipe dream that is.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_12">
		<text>Ever meet a stalker called Magpie?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_121">

		<text>There's a technician called Nitro over at Yanov station. He's pretty good with electronics. I once forgot the password to my PDA, and he cracked it in five seconds flat!</text>

		<text>I have the Duty trader's PDA. You know anyone who would be interested in it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_151">
		<text>A trader in Duty? That's impossible! Then again, if you have some information then you'd best hand it over to Lieutenant Colonel Shulga and let him deal with it.</text>

	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_16">
		<text>Where can I find tools around here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_163">
		<text>There's a whole plant nearby. Of course, it may have already been looted by now, but I'd still check the plant warehouses if I were you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_165">
		<text>I'd start looking in the old workshops if I were you. You might also find something in stores.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_166">
		<text>There're only mutants and anomalies around here. Hah! I wouldn't look in anomalies, and burers and controllers won't help you with that either.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_169">
		<text>Actually, there's a train under the bridge around here. I've seen them before - they're usually used to transport technical personnel, so you might be able to find some tools in there.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_172">
		<text>You need to see a technician about that. The only decent technician around is Nitro at Yanov.</text>

		<text>Who could break into a steel container?</text>
	</string>

	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_182">
		<text>Hah, you might as well carry a safe around with you. I'm sure Nitro won't be able to help you with that... if it had an electronic lock, it might be a different story...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_19">
		<text>I'm looking for a stalker called Snag. Do you know where I can find him?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_191">
		<text>You'd better ask the stalkers - they know their own. I've never heard of Snog or whatever his name is.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_2">
		<text>Do you know anything about the crashed helicopters?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_20">
		<text>Who might be interested in information about Duty's founder?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_201">
		<text>Our commander, of course. Report everything you know to Shulga and you'll get Duty's gratitude for sure.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_22">
		<text>Yeah, our scouts saw a military helicopter descend towards the reserve pads by Jupiter. They said they kept signalling them to change course but I guess the pilots had other things to worry about. I wonder if the army boys managed to get out of the mine field okay.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_23">
		<text>Not around here, no. Our presence here is limited... try asking our boys near Yanov.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_25">
		<text>Our patrol reported that a military helicopter attempted a crash landing near the Jupiter plant. Unfortunately, the chopper crashed right into the roof above the workshops. There are probably no survivors - the patrol didn't receive any distress signals after the crash.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_3">
		<text>You saw any military around?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_30">
		<text>Who could be interested in maps of the area between Zaton and Jupiter?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_301">
		<text>Someone who has some use for them. I'm talking about Pilot - he's a guide on the route between Yanov and Skadovsk, so he'd find those maps useful, that's for sure.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_31">
		<text>Military? I've not seen any around here, but we don't spend much time in this area.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_35">
		<text>A soldier's corpse was spotted in the mine field recently. He's probably one of the fellas that flew in in that chopper. The chopper carries up to eight people in addition to the crew, so they must have found a way out, though nobody knows where they went.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_36">
		<text>A military fella was seen at the scientists' bunker, and he only got there recently. I don't know the details.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_37">
		<text>Some guy in military uniform was seen entering a building by the Volkhov AA complex the other day. It's quite possible that it was just a zombie mistaken for a soldier though.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_38">
		<text>Stalkers spotted a military unit near Jupiter plant. Judging by the description it was special forces. They were accompanied by an unidentified stalker and headed towards Pripyat. This sounds reliable, but experience shows that information like that usually can't be trusted.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_4">
		<text>Do you know how to get to Pripyat?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_40">
		<text>Who could I hire to protect the scientists?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_401">
		<text>They won't find better protection than Duty will provide. Go see Lieutenant Colonel Shulga at Yanov - I'm sure the two of you will work something out.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_402">
		<text>Nah. While they've got Freedom people working for them, we'll stay well away from that place. Listening to those idiots crack their shitty jokes all day long is a fate worse than death.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_42">
		<text>Duty has no reason to look for a way to Pripyat at the moment, but we're collecting information anyway. There are unconfirmed reports that tunnels under the Jupiter plant lead to Pripyat. Checking this information would require searching everything in the plant area thoroughly.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_43">
		<text>No. If you need that kind of information you'll have to speak to a civilian guide - our scouts have enough on their plates as it is.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_44">
		<text>Our scouts regularly check the area for safe paths to Pripyat, but that hasn't yielded any results as yet.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_5">
		<text>Can you suggest anyone that's not too tied down who'd be willing to make a move for Pripyat?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_51">
		<text>Duty's presence in this area is limited. Speak to our people at Yanov.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_52">
		<text>There's a rumour that the scientists have a military guy in their bunker. He hasn't got much of a way out, though. You see, the scientists are there for twelve to eighteen months, and he's not going to get to the edge of the Zone on foot and on his own. Considering that, I bet he'd be interested.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_53">
		<text>I suggest you look among people who're after adventures. For example, there's a stalker called Vano over at Yanov station. He doesn't care what kind of shit he gets himself into, and he could be useful - that boy can find a way through an anomaly with his eyes closed.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_54">
		<text>Well, you could start a recruitment campaign in a mental hospital... Then again, I know a good alternative - Monolith fighters. Speaking of which, a squad of them was spotted near AA complex, and they probably even know the way to Pripyat, too... Hey girl, I hope you're not taking me seriously...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_56">
		<text>Look for volunteers in Duty. Strider, for example. He hasn't got a mission yet, so I figure the Lieutenant Colonel might let him go with you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_57">
		<text>Everyone knows that Duty's got the best fighters... but we've got other objectives at the moment.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_6">
		<text>I found an unusual shooter. Do you know anyone who might know something about it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_62">
		<text>Well, I'll be! That's some cannon! Did you make it yourself or did you really find it? I've never seen anything like it... Ask the technicians.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_7">
		<text>Who could I hire to take measurements for the scientists?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_71">
		<text>That's a dumb question - Duty, of course. We've got lots of folks with experience, and we've worked with the scientists before. Go see Lieutenant Colonel Shulga - I'm sure he'll find a squad for the job.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_72">
		<text>Who'd want to work there if the bunker is protected by Freedom? Those friggin' pacifists are so stoned most of the time they're just as likely to shoot each other as the enemy.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_8">
		<text>I found a very strange artefact. Can you suggest a buyer?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_81">
		<text>Artefacts are all strange and I wouldn't advise carrying it on you either. Hand it over to the experts and be done with it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_83">
		<text>You should show that thing to stalkers - they're experts in that kind of shit. Better still, show it to the person they sell their artefacts to.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_9">
		<text>I found a whole bloodsucker lair nearby. What are we gonna do?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_91">
		<text>Duty squads are not currently engaging in purging operations in this area, so the lair will have to wait.</text>

	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_111">
		<text>Loads... A nice story, I'll give you that. A palace in the sands, an island in the mist, a castle in the sky... Shangri La, Eden... the Oasis. Every free person has a dream and I don't blame 'em for it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_112">
		<text>Well, I did hear an interesting story from this one stalker. I think he was the first person to mention the Oasis to me. He said that according to legend, all your wounds heal there and you become calm and relaxed, as if you're not in the Zone at all. I haven't seen him since... It was only after he left that I remembered that he used to walk with a limp, but when he left he walked straight and looked like he'd gotten a hell of a lot younger.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_113">
		<text>Yes, free stalkers gave me the coordinates... Ten different sets of coordinates. Putting them together gives us an area from the Scorcher to the CNPP with the Yanov bar somewhere near the centre. It's entirely possible that we're in the Oasis right now, so enjoy it!</text>

	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_141">
		<text>I heard that Nitro at Yanov is a fan of combinations and algorithms. I'm not sure though, I've never really spoken to him - he's working for Duty, so he ain't got much time for us free folk.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_143">
		<text>I'm not much of an expert on local experts... Ask our boys over at Yanov next time you're there - they'll know for sure.</text>

		<text>Where can I find tools around here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_163">
		<text>At the plant, girl, where else? It's not exactly lively in there, but the warehouses will cheer you up. It's a bit safer and you're bound to find some decent tools in there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_165">
		<text>That's a good question, girl. Let's think about this one. Where do you find tools outside the Zone? Now, if you got half a brain, you buy them in a store... If you don't, you look for the tools and a brain in a workshop. Right? It's the same thing in the Zone - you have to look in the same places. It's that simple, stalker!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_166">
		<text>Tools? Listen, girl, is that code for something? There're no pigs here or anything, you can speak freely... Oh, you're serious? In that case I really don't know.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_169">
		<text>Well, I heard that one of our boys was looking for tools, and he got into the train under the bridge. Apparently, there's a Tesla there... Anyway, he said it wasn't fun in there...

		<text>Who can unblock a memory module?</text>

	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_171">
		<text>Well, Tukarev in the scientists' bunker can do it. He's fast, good and polite. There's also Nitro at Yanov, the Duty hanger-on. He's cheap and shitty, but he'll probably do the job.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_172">
		<text>A skilled technician, I guess. The local one is more about mechanical stuff, so unless you need your memory module's barrel rifled, I suggest you ask at Jupiter.</text>

		<text>Who could break into a steel container?</text>

	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_181">

	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_182">

	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_22">
		<text>Yeah, you heard that story about the chopper in the mine field? Basically, the jar-heads crashed onto the reserve landing pad which their fellow jar-heads mined six years back. Now some folks say they did it out of stupidity, but I figure there's more to it than that. Look at it like this: nobody is gonna go there, so once the army boys complete their mission they can return to the chopper, patch it up a bit and off they go.

		<text>Yeah, some boys spotted a chopper flying real messy like the other day. It didn't land in a good place either - right onto one of the Jupiter roofs. The said it crashed and then went through the roof into the building, dragging all kinds of crap down with it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_3">
		<text>You saw any military around?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_30">
		<text>Who could be interested in maps of the area between Zaton and Jupiter?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_301">
		<text>Pilot for sure, girl. He's the main free stalker guide around here - if you want to talk maps, he's the one you want.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_31">
		<text>Chill, girl. There ain't no cops, no jar-heads and no friggin' militia around here - you're as safe as can be in the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_35">
		<text>No, but some fellas told me they saw an army unit crawling through the mine field by the helipads. Those fellas thought about helping them but decided against it. The jar-heads are an unpredictable breed, you never know when they'll snap and shoot you in the back.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_36">
		<text>I ain't seen any myself but rumour has it that there's a jar-head at the scientists' bunker. Ozersky, the biologist, said that he's from that chopper which crashed into the plant... The joke doing the rounds is that the nerds have got themselves a pet soldier.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_37">
		<text>Not personally, but I heard some things from free stalkers. They said that a jar-head was spotted by the Volkhov AA complex. Gotta be a ghost or a zombie that's woken up... what do you reckon?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_38">
		<text>Nah. This one fella was sayin' that he saw seven soldiers following a free stalker past the radio plant towards Pripyat. There ain't been any weed in the Zone for a while, so I figure that's gotta be crazy talk, pure and simple.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_4">
		<text>Do you know how to get to Pripyat?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_40">
		<text>Who could I hire to protect the scientists?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_401">
		<text>Freedom, us in other words. We work with the scientists all the time, so guarding them would be piece of cake for us. Talk to our boss Loki over at Yanov - he'll agree for sure.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_402">
		<text>I ain't sure, friend, 'cause from what I've been hearing, the eggheads hired a Duty squad to work for them... We'd love to guard the scientists, but staring at those constipated Duty faces every day just ain't worth it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_42">
		<text>They say you can get there from Jupiter... I mean the plant, not the planet... Hah! That's a good one, you gotta admit!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_43">
		<text>You know, I ain't got a clue. Just can't find the time to go there... I'd ask Pilot in the camp, yeah? He's a free stalker and knows the area better than anyone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_44">
		<text>Sis, if I knew I'd have gone there a long time ago. Getting away from Duty, the jar-heads and all this fighting would be worth it...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_5">
		<text>Can you suggest anyone that's not too tied down who'd be willing to make a move for Pripyat?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_51">
		<text>Sorry, friend, I don't know anyone at Zaton... Take my advice and ask our boys at Yanov.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_52">
		<text>You know the scientists' bunker? Well, they've got a situation on their hands over there. First Garry, the stalker, decided to make for Pripyat and now the jar-head who's there got the same idea. Garry is a loner and proud of it, but that jar-head is exactly what you're looking for.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_53">
		<text>Vano at Yanov is as good as any. He's a decent fella and he could have joined Freedom any time if he wanted. I gather he ain't keen on our struggle with Duty... or any kind of struggle, for that matter. That's his view of things and we respect it!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_54">
		<text>Sure thing. One of our guys spotted a squad by the dry lake. They're bound to know Pripyat like the back of their hands, and they don't seem to be working for anyone. They're sure to be brave, too, 'cause they're Monolith fighters!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_55">
		<text>Yeah. Strider, the leader of our new recruits... it seems he feels uneasy in our ranks. His boys have adapted just fine, but he's not all that happy here... Speak to him - I hate to see a good man being where his heart don't lie...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_57">
		<text>Nah, no clue.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_6">
		<text>I found an unusual shooter. Do you know anyone who might know something about it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_62">
		<text>You didn't find a manual to go along with it, did you? No? No idea then.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_7">
		<text>Who could I hire to take measurements for the scientists?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_71">
		<text>I reckon our boys could do the job. Freedom has its share of smart folks and if we don't know something we'll ask at the bunker. We'd love the opportunity to help science! Speak to Loki at Yanov - I'm sure he'll say the same.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_72">
		<text>Me and the boys would love to do it, but Duty's guarding the bunker these days. Popping in to see the scientists is a problem as it is, but being there every day just wouldn't be healthy, that's for damn sure.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_8">
		<text>I found a very strange artefact. Can you suggest a buyer?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_81">
		<text>You need a collector, buddy. You won't find one at Yanov , seeing as even some stalkers are afraid of coming here. You'd best ask at Zaton, it's a bit quieter in those parts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_83">
		<text>You know Beard, the barman in the free stalker camp? He buys up artefacts and don't rip you off too much either. A nice fella, whichever way you look at it. It's a pity he don't work for us, really.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_9">
		<text>I found a whole bloodsucker lair nearby. What are we gonna do?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_91">
		<text>Girl, you gotta warn the free stalkers - they've got their main camp around here, after all. The Zone's wildlife is valuable, to be sure, but I'm more concerned about the people in this place.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_98">
		<text>Okay, forget about it.</text>

	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_0">
		<text>Heard any news around here lately?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_1">
		<text>Like what?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_10">
		<text>What do you think about Nimble?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_101">
		<text>I ain't had the pleasure... You'd best ask some Skadovsk regulars.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_11">
		<text>You hear anything about the Oasis?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_111">
		<text>I've heard everything about the Oasis! It's a legend, a myth... every stalker expects something different from it and every damn one of them claims to know the exact location. It's a pity the only thing those locations have in common is that they're friggin' hard to reach.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_112">
		<text>Well, they say that wounds heal instantly there and your energy is replenished in minutes... They say no disease or sickness can last in the Oasis, not even radiation poisoning! The one thing I know for sure, though, is its whereabouts... Wanna know? It's in the centre of the Zone! But you gotta keep this between us, not a word to anyone!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_113">
		<text>I heard that any mutant you meet there will just walk on by without so much as looking at you. They also say that there's an artefact there called the Heart of the Oasis... Nobody knows what it does exactly, but one thing's for sure: you shouldn't touch it. Anyone who takes it won't have no place in the Zone no more... Location? Girl, everyone knows it's in Pripyat under the Ferris wheel! I mean, where else would it be?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_12">
		<text>Ever meet a stalker called Magpie?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_121">
		<text>Sure have... No idea where he is now though.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_122">
		<text>Hrm... Never heard of him...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_13">
		<text>Do you know who could have stolen things from a personal box?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_131">
		<text>Err, no? Ask the senior folk at Yanov, they might be able to help you out.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_14">
		<text>Who could help me with decrypting something here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_141">
		<text>Nitro at Yanov, who else? He loves that complicated technology shit... a lot more than he loves dealing with shooters.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_143">
		<text>Nobody I know. Ask at Yanov - they've got an expert there of some kind.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_15">
		<text>I have the Duty trader's PDA. You know anyone who would be interested in it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_151">
		<text>You know Owl at Skadovsk? I reckon he'd be glad to get his hands on it. He likes to get involved in sensitive business...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_152">
		<text>There used to be a fella called Owl on Skadovsk over at Zaton. He deals in information... your PDA might be of interest to him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_16">
		<text>Where can I find tools around here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_161">
		<text>A stalker told me that his old man was working in the substation workshops before 86. He said they had all kinds of equipment there, so I'm guessing there will be tools, too. It's probably all rusted to shit by now, but it might be worth a look anyway.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_162">
		<text>You know the sawmill in the wood on the hill? There should be some tools there, unless someone got to them first, that is. I doubt that, though: the closer you get to that place the more you feel like shitting your pants and running the hell away. It ain't even the radiation that's scary, I'll leave it at that...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_163">
		<text>Well, the Jupiter plant is right here and there's bound to be some tools in there. Personally, I wouldn't go near the plant itself... that place gives me the creeps. You could have a look in the Jupiter warehouses, the ones on the side of the plant.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_164">
		<text>I heard there's a couple of places in Pripyat where you can find all kinds of technical junk. One of them is supposed to be the old Soviet department store. It was pretty much the only place that had anything useful for sale back in the day.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_165">
		<text>How am I supposed to know? Check in old workshops or stores, there could be something usable there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_166">
		<text>To be honest, the last place I saw decent tools was in Sidorovich's bunker at the Cordon. Sure, you have to pay for them, but they're new and not all that expensive either.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_167">
		<text>You know, buddy, I didn't come to the Zone to search for tools. Think about it, how much use is a radioactive hammer?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_168">
		<text>I heard a rumour that you can pick up bits and pieces at the old service centre... You might be able to find tools there, too. But just as with anything else: the only way to get the good stuff is to get to it first.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_169">
		<text>Good question... I'd check in the old train under the bridge if I were you. Don't ask why... My gut tells me you might find something.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_17">
		<text>Who can unblock a memory module?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_171">
		<text>Let me think... Well, Nitro at Yanov will be able to do it for sure. Other than that, there's also Tukarev, the scientists' technician and a real pro. You gotta think about what you want though, 'cause Nitro is a lot cheaper.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_172">
		<text>Well, you'll need a technician, but the only one around here is Cardan. Thing is, after that many years at the bottom of a bottle, he's not exactly safe around complex electronics. I'd ask around at Jupiter if I were you - they've got the right experts there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_18">
		<text>Who could break into a steel container?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_181">
		<text>Cardan at Skadovsk, I guess. I mean, the way he cuts through padlocks is a joy to watch.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_182">
		<text>A technician of some kind, I suppose. Nitro probably won't do it though - he's not into the rough stuff.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_183">
		<text>Hah, you're asking that in Pripyat?! Take my advice and look for someone a bit further away from the centre of the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_19">
		<text>I'm looking for a stalker called Snag. Do you know where I can find him?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_191">
		<text>Better ask Beard, the barman over at Skadovsk. He usually knows where stalkers are.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_193">
		<text>Snag? How the hell should I know? You'd best ask at Zaton, he hangs around there a lot of the time.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_2">
		<text>Do you know anything about the crashed helicopters?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_20">
		<text>Who's interested in information about Duty's founder?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_201">
		<text>I'd have a chat with Owl, the information trader at Skadovsk. You can bet your ass he'll be interested in credible info on a legend like that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_21">
		<text>I saw one myself... It didn't look like it crashed but it wasn't flying good either. It was swinging from side to side until it landed on a plateau in the south of Zaton... It'd be interesting to see whether anyone survived... If we only knew a way to get up there. Actually, I heard Noah from the psycho barge might know...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_22">
		<text>I heard about a few military choppers crashing not far from here... People say different things, but there's one I remember clearly. They said it landed on the reserve helipad that jar-heads themselves mined back in the day. Can you believe the irony in that shit? My old man used to say: 'Don't dig a hole for another, 'cause you'll be the one that falls in it.' True, ain't it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_23">
		<text>A buddy of mine told me this story... He went to the Iron Forest to get some artefacts and as soon as he got there he heard this crash behind him. He turned to see what it was and saw a chopper coming towards him at full speed, taking down pylons and shit on its way. He bolted the hell outta there... I'm surprised he made it out without landing in an anomaly. You won't have much trouble finding the Iron Forest - you can see it from miles off. It's full of friggin' poltergeists, too, so keep your wits about ya.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_24">
		<text>I heard one landed on the southern plateau but getting up there ain't easy. The other thing I heard is that someone spotted Noah on the edge of that plateau, which means that psycho knows a way of getting to it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_25">
		<text>I've not seen any myself but rumour has it that one crashed right into the plant... Nobody wants to check it out though - the place is just too dangerous.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_26">
		<text>One stalker told me he saw several military helis getting into some trouble... He saw the engine on one light up and then it went straight down into a swamp full of anomalies. You'll be able to get there easy enough, but the swamp itself is a friggin' nightmare... It's no place for humans, believe you me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_3">
		<text>You saw any military around?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_30">
		<text>Who could be interested in maps of the area between Zaton and Jupiter?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_301">
		<text>Pilot, who the hell else? He's a guide, you know? Constantly making trips between Skadovsk and Yanov, so he'll find a use for your maps sure enough.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_302">
		<text>This ain't Zaton or Jupiter, so these maps are useless here, right? Ask around in those places and you might have more luck!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_31">
		<text>I didn't see any myself but I heard a story about some soldiers getting down from the southern plateau on the sewerage works side. Apparently they tried to get down all proper at first, using cables and shit. But then gave up and slid down on their asses, hah! Zone bobsled - gotta love it!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_32">
		<text>I heard a conversation at Skadovsk about five or so jar-heads who were spotted coming out of a drainage tunnel by the swamp. They said the soldiers were dirty as hell, and one of them you couldn't even tell from a swamp bloodsucker, covered in slime from head to toe.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_33">
		<text>Not personally, but a friend of mine saw a military unit engage a group of mercs by the processing station. But by the time he found a nice spot to enjoy the show it was over 'cause the jar-heads fell back. No casualties on either side either... typical, ain't it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_34">
		<text>Apparently ten or so jar-heads were spotted hanging around Noah's barge. Now, given that the psycho was alive at this point, he probably came to some sort of agreement with them... which is just like him. Obviously nobody wanted to ask Noah about what happened - you never know what to expect from that crazy son of a bitch.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_35">
		<text>I heard something explode at night and then someone at Yanov told me that they saw a dead jar-head in the old mine field and an abandoned army chopper behind him. Seems they couldn't tell where they landed in the dark and went straight across the mines. Nobody knows how many of them made it out of there, but I doubt he flew that chopper in on his own.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_36">
		<text>I've not really seen any military... but I've heard rumours that a jar-head is hanging around with the scientists. The story goes that Garry, a stalker, found him when he went into the missile complex to look for his buddies. Now, the complex is crawling with zombies who aren't exactly friendly to stray humans, so Garry basically saved him from certain death.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_37">
		<text>No, but I heard that a jar-head was spotted by the Volkhov AA complex. I don't really believe it though... They could be lying or maybe they just can't tell a zombie from a soldier.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_38">
		<text>Military? Well, I heard people saying that 'a whole military unit lead by a stalker' was making its way past the Jupiter plant, but I didn't pay much attention to that gossip.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_4">
		<text>Do you know how to get to Pripyat?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_40">
		<text>Who could I hire to protect the scientists?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_401">
		<text>You know Spartacus and his squad? You know, the stalkers at Zaton? They're good people and decent fighters - they've been there, done that and got the T-shirt. I have a feeling they'd like the idea of guarding the scientists.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_402">
		<text>Did you run into Hatchet's squad by the substation workshops at Zaton? They've got their problems, like all mercs, but at least they ask questions first and shoot later. I'm guessing if you manage to sign them up for this job, the scientists will be pleased and stalkers can relax a little, too. Everyone's happy, right?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_403">
		<text>Erm... Nothing comes to mind... No, sorry.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_41">
		<text>What I know for sure is that there's no way of getting there from Zaton. Everyone who was bursting to get to Pripyat headed towards Jupiter, so you should ask around in those parts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_42">
		<text>Well, rumour has it that there are secret tunnels to Pripyat underneath the Jupiter plant... The thing is, these rumours usually get told after the second round, and then Jupiter is such a friggin' nightmare that nobody dares goes near it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_43">
		<text>How should I know, girl? You got any easier questions for me? All I can say is that you should find Pilot and talk to him - if anyone can help you, it's him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_44">
		<text>Hah, if I knew the way to Pripyat I wouldn't be here. Why do you think I went towards the centre of the Zone? Pripyat is full of artefacts, girl! Whoever gets there first is gonna be living the high life!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_5">
		<text>Can you suggest anyone that's not too tied down who'd be willing to make a move for Pripyat?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_51">
		<text>I don't think there's anyone like that around here. Everyone who wanted to be closer to the centre of the Zone left for Jupiter. That's where I'd ask if I were you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_52">
		<text>You heard about the jar-head who's with the scientists at the moment? I reckon he ain't got much to lose by going with you. The scientists are not leaving any time soon, he can't reach the Cordon on his own, so he just might be dumb enough to go to Pripyat with you!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_53">
		<text>You know Vano over at Yanov station? He's an honest fella, a good stalker and gullible as hell. Now there's a cat who's better off around anomalies than people - so long as he's here there will always be someone to take advantage of him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_54">
		<text>Listen lass, I heard that a squad was spotted by the dry lake south of the AA complex... Apparently they're not the usual stalkers or Freedom or Duty - they're Monolith men! So if you need someone to go to Pripyat with, they're just the ticket. Haha, you do realize I'm kidding, right?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_55">
		<text>You know Strider, the leader of the new Freedom squad? If you saw his miserable kisser, you'd know for yourself that Yanov ain't the place for him. You should try speaking to him. He might actually go for it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_56">

	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_503">

	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_502">

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_24">
		<text>I heard there's an anomaly called «Amoeba». You can't see it until you step right on it. When you step on it - a jellyfish-like thing will jump from below the ground and float in the air. If it'll touch you - say goodbye. This «Amoeba» is fully covered in some kind of acid that can dissolve any suits with ease. You can find this anomaly in a forest or a swamp. So if you ever decide to visit a grassy place - remember to throw bolts.</text>

		<text>I heard about a rare anomaly called «Witches' jelly». They say that this isn't just an anomaly, but an artificial one, created even before the Second disaster. It looks a lot like "Fruit punch" - a green shining puddle. But it's actually a fungus that spreads across your whole body, disintegrating all tissues on contact. So if you ever touch this anomaly - immediately cut off the limb that made contact. Or else you will become a part of that puddle.</text>

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_26">
		<text>Ecologists have told me about an interesting anomaly - «Mosquito bald». It works like a gravitational field that changes the direction of objects inside it.

		<text>Some guy told me... There's a very rare anomaly - «Dead zone». Nor your eyes, nor detector can see it. Radiation inside that zone is even worse than at the Radar, and all devices stop working near it. If somebody enters it - he'll either die instantly or in 2-3 days. The scariest part is - they'll just drop dead, like from a heart attack. The body organs are fine, no punctures, not even scratches. The living will just become the dead.</text>

		<text>Did you know that the «Mama beads» artefact wasn't formed in thermal anomalies before? I heard that there was an anomaly called the «Time machine». The anomaly itself is harmless, but time inside it feels like it goes way slower. If you get inside it - you'll have to spend a lot of time getting out. And right in the centre of it the «Mama beads» were formed. And what's interesting, the moment you grab the artefact - anomaly disappears, like it was never there...</text>

		<text>You know, «Electras» are nothing. I heard about more interesting electrical anomaly - «Meat grinder». Sparkles flying in the air, ground discharging. The anomaly builds up a charge of electricity inside itself, doesn't react to any objects, but when a living thing happen to enter it's range - a discharge strikes from the centre of it, twisting and tearing the body apart. And after that, the anomaly becomes harmless for some time, until it'll recharge completely.</text>

But, contrary to «Burnt fuzz», this lichen doesn't care if you walk past it at slow or high speed - if you touch it, you'll instantly get strong burn. And that's not the end of it. If something touches the «Rusty hair», it's vines will spread out, trying to catch as much objects as possible. Not bad for a linchen, eh?</text>

If you throw something in that steam - it turns into flames. And what's interesting: the temperature of the flames were lower than it is now, which means you could get away with just a burn. And if you get hit by «Comet» now - you become dead. Maybe the radiation changed it somehow, maybe something else...</text>

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_32">
		<text>Recently I heard about a strange anomaly - the «Grabber». It looks like some sort of a plant, laying in bushes, almost invisible. If you step on it - it'll slam shut, catching you inside. And if you get trapped there - say goodbye, you'll get dissolved like a fly. But if you walk through it slowly, like you do with «Burnt fuzz», the anomaly won't react at all.

		<text>I heard that there was an anomaly before - «Black thorn». It looked like a lot of black needles in the ground, if you touch them - they'll shoot themselves towards you, piercing even strong vests. And for the scariest part - if it hits an animal or a human, more needles will grow from it's flesh, tearing through the skin. I dunno why is it not present anymore, tho I heard some stalkers found a way to get rid of it completely. Any way, good thing that it's gone.</text>

		<text>I met a strange thing some time ago - something like orange fog. I was with a companion then, he thought it was just evaporations - the thing took place in the swamps. My companion made a step inside it and suddenly stopped. I pat his shoulder, and he looks at me with such anger. I saw him grabbing his rifle, so I pulled him from the fog - he passed out immediately. When he came to his senses, he told me, that once he stepped inside the fog - everything became orange and hateful. And when he saw me - hatred filled him so much, he wanted to kill me. When we got back to the camp, we asked some veterans about it, and they told us that it was an anomaly - «Crazy gas». Good thing I was able to save my partner, or else one of us would end up dead right there. And even worse - both of us.</text>

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_40">
		<text>There's an anomaly called «Slaughterhouse». It doesn't look special, just a weird shadow on the ground. If you step inside it - it will squeeze your lungs when you'll try to breathe in. It's like the air is way too heavy, or the other way around. Yeah...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_41">
		<text>I heard about an anomaly called «Goo». It looks like a brown bubbling puddle. Or like a boiling mud. If something falls in it - the puddle will foam up and splash out a five-meter column of brown dirt in the air. This dirt will then fall down on the ground, melting everything, even rocks. After the dirt falls down, it evaporates into toxic gas, so you don't want to get near it without a mask. The best way to deal with this anomaly is to walk around it at safe distance. And don't even think of throwing something into the puddle, unless you want to become a melted corpse.</text>

		<text>Once, I went on a raid with my friend. We found a strange field that wasn't even marked on the map. Well, we were very young then, so we decided to try walking through it. The further we went, the more sleepy we became. I realised that something was off, so I shook my friend on the shoulder and ran. He understood and ran after me. I almost fell down from the tiredness, but we were able to get out. When we got out, we felt such a thirst that we almost drank all the water we had. Later, I asked an experienced stalker about that field. He told me that this field - is an anomaly, called «Poppy field». It will make you sleepy, and if you fall asleep - you won't wake up, ever. I think it's obvious that we never went there again.</text>

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_43">
		<text>I heard about a very scary anomaly, called the «Web». It looks like a very thin strings between the trees - you won't notice them unless you use a flashlight to light them up. Detector will only react to it when you get very close to the string, so if you won't be walking slow - you won't be able to react in time. The string itself is very thin and very sharp, even sharper than the knife. It will cut through any vest like through butter, so you can imagine what will happen to the bare flesh. But what's strange: the moment string starts to cut through flesh - it gets torn apart, leaving only big bleeding wounds behind.</text>

		<text>I was once exploring the old houses that are scattered around - almost got into a strange anomaly. That house looked just like the rest, but one of the walls was completely ruined. And everything that would get inside the house would fly out that broken wall at huge speed. Good thing I have a habit of throwing bolts in front of me. Or else I would end up flying out. I later asked a friends of mine about that thing. They told me that it was an anomaly called "Vacuum cleaner". They said it can not only push you out, but also suck you in with huge strength, squishing human like a sponge. So remember to throw bolts, mate.</text>

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_45">
		<text>I heard about a place where veterans love to scary rookies. That place has a unique anomaly in it - the «Stomper». This anomaly is completely invisible, but as you enter it you immediately hear some kind of stomping in the distance. The more time you spend inside, the closer the stomping grows. And when it gets very very close - it suddenly disappears, leaving only silence behind. Experienced stalkers love to take rookies to that place - to laugh as newbies are scared to death, trying to find the source of the sound. But recently one of the rookies got so scared, he pulled out his gun and shot in the distance few times, hitting one of the stalkers in the arm. Since then stalkers have stopped toying with rookies at that place.</text>

Though, he didn't talk to anyone and acted weirdly. Some people thought that he got zombified. But he looked completely normal. He just arrived at the camp, walked around a bit and left, not saying a word. One hour later, his group arrived. Stalkers asked them, why did they split up with the Stagger, which got the group very surprised. They said that Stagger died in an emission two days ago, they buried him. Everyone got shocked. Everyone, excluding the one old stalker that was in the Zone since the first days. He said that it's a very rare anomaly - if a stalker happens to die during an emission, his "twin" will appear somewhere in the Zone. This "copy" will then wander across the Zone, and usually it dies in a short time due to some anomaly. Though, the old man didn't know the name for that anomaly, so stalkers decided to name it «Stagger», in the memory of the stalker. Yeah...</text>

It created an illusion that lab was completely fine, like it was cleaned every day by someone. This mutant could also control people. Stalker noted that this "mass" contacted him and asked to build some kind of cart so that this mass could get outside. It seems like stalker ran out of the lab, but mutant was able to get into his brain - when they found stalker's body, he was laying with a hole in his head and a pistol in hand.

Stalkers got tired of this shit, one of them sped up and caught the karlick. Suddenly, karlick puts his hands on stalker's head, making him scream at the top of his lungs. Everyone got scared and opened fire at the mutants. As a result, ecologists received three dead karlicks. They did save that one stalker, he said that the mutant tried to get into his head.

		<text>One veteran stalker told me such story. He once caught a SOS signal on his PDA. When he arrived at the spot, he only found five bodies and one barely alive stalker. He carefully approached the wounded, when stalker says: "Everyone is dead... Help me, please. I won't be able to stand up by myself". Well, veteran approached him, raised him on his shoulder and left the place. He walks back to camp when wounded says: "Look, a house... let's rest there for a bit". Stalker didn't like the idea, but he was tired, so he walked towards the house. He only made a few steps inside, when the door suddenly closed. Stalker immediatly threw the wounded on the bed, pulled out his gun and turned around. A weird mutant, straight from the nightmares, jumped towards him. It looked like a naked humanoid monster with ugly face and some kind of bat wings. Mutant raised it's arm, stalker aimed his gun - when suddenly a wounded guy pulls him by his leg. Stalker fell down, but still pressed the trigger. He got lucky and hit it dead. Stalker turned to the wounded - he was completely dead. Later, stalker found out that this mutant is called mimicry. It can read dead person's memory and control it's body, like a marionette, to lure it's prey into a trap.</text>

		<text>I heard that there were strange mutants in Pripyat Undergrounds before - they were called morloks. They were people before, and when the disaster occured they were underground, where they mutated. They looked a bit like humans, tho they were very ugly. Their skin was blue, they had a big tumour on their head that covered half of their face, the other half didn't look pretty either. One of their arms was usually hypertrophied. And what's interesting: they had some kind of intelligence. They made clothes for themselves and used guns. They could even use grenades. In general - very dangerous mutant. Tho I heard that monolithians killed all of them while they were taking over the underground.</text>

		<text>I heard that there's a very creepy mutant, called the mummy. The mutant itself isn't big and doesn't attack stalkers. But it parasitizes on corpses, using them as part of it's body. It would find two human bodies and merge with them, becoming one big mutant that could even hunt stalkers. I heard that these mutants live somewhere in Pripyat Undergrounds...

		<text>Dutyers told me that Dead City was full of zombies before. And not just zombies, but some weird ones, with parasites that took over their heads. Those parasytes spread their spores in the air, and if those spores get inside a human or a dog, they would multiply inside the body until they grow up so big that they can eat the brain. After that they "hatch" through the head, releasing tentacles in the body. That way they can control their preys. And Dead City was really infested with those parasites. Good thing that Duty was able to stop them from spreading. It would be a real apocalypse if they didn't. I think Freedom noticed that city was cleared and moved in then.</text>

They were guarding a facility that was hidden underground.</text>

		<text>One story I've heard... In one of the laboratories they were experimenting on humans. Scientists there tried to create super soldiers. But they couldn't complete their research - something happened in the lab and all staff died. And the survived "super soldiers" grouped together and set up their lair in that particular lab. They also had a pseudogiant trapped on the lowest floor - they were scared of him so much, they caught stalkers, stunned them and threw them to him. The "soldiers" themselves weren't intelligent, they were more like a zombies, but I heard that some of them could talk. Stalkers named them pseudohumans. Yep. They all are dead now, probably. That's good, I think.</text>

		<text>Stalkers that visited labs told me such story. There were piles of bodies laying in one room. And not a single body had a head. But they weren't just severed - they were very carefully amputated. And mechanical details were inserted in their bodies. Stalkers also found a document that mentioned a project called «Collector». The details that were inserted in those bodies allowed someone to control them remotely. Some sort of biological robots. Creepy stuff. Good thing that project wasn't successful. I wouldn't like ending up as one of their toys...</text>

		<text>I heard that there was a strange mutant living in the lake near Dead City, stalkers called it «Sentient lake». It looked like a very ugly giant crab. This mutant sat in that lake and controlled all the mutants around. And not just mutants - it could even control stalkers, if they would get too close. It created a lot of problems for the ecologists. They got tired of it and created some sort of device that would imitate the work of zombie's brain. They hired freedomers to grab this device and go to the lake. Freedomers mined whole place, retreated and blew it up. For next few days, the eggheads were wandering around, collecting pieces of the mutant.</text>

		<text>I heard that there was another psy-emitter at the Yantar before, tho this one was biological. It controlled all mutants in the area, gathering them around itself. The emitter was placed underground, and getting to it without psy-helmet wasn't possible. Well, eggheads made a prototype and sent a group of stalkers there. Only one of them returned, but the psy-emitter was turned off.</text>

		<text>One veteran stalker told me one story. He and his friends were hired by ecologists to turn off one bio psy-emitter. They were given psy-helmets sent to poisonous swamp. As they were shooting off the mutants, they found an underground passage there. They went inside. As they walk through dark corridor, they suddenly feel a very strong ringing in their ears. Stalker opens his eyes and sees only darkness. He heard a muffled voice mumble something in th distance. He had no other choice but to follow the voice. As he walks towards the voice, it grows louder and more audible. The voice was saying fragments of phrases. Stalker turned around the corner and saw light. As he entered it, he found himself on a street. He looked closer and realised that it was Lenin's square. The he saw few stalkers staying underneath the monument, their backs turned at him.  Suddenly, they all turned around, and as the voice grew more evil, they raised their guns. Stalker had no choice but to shoot. As he got closer to their bodies, he realised that those were his companions. Looks like this emitter zombified them somehow. Stalker grieved for a moment, gathered his strength and continued on. He entered a building and walked through a very long corridor with many closed doors. One of the doors was open, stalker entered it. As he entered the room, he saw a strange scary mutant inside the big incubator, surrounded by phantoms. Stalker's vision started getting darker by a moment, but he didn't fall - he grabbed his grenade and threw it tat the monster. Good thing that he was able to hind behind the table. Grenade went off and stalker felt his head getting lighter as the "emitter" died. He took a look around, wandered across the underground, grabbed some stuff and returned to the ecologists. They paid him well, but he didn't do any business with them after that. I can understand him...</text>

Karkils were afraid of him so much, they didn't even went down to him - they just left food at the entrance of his floor and did everything he asked.

Suddenly, he felt that something was off. He turns around and sees that all tools came to life and begun to crawl towards him. And not just tools - all the machines too! He started blasting in every direction as he ran away. He never visited that factory again. To be honest, I don't believe his story. I know that he never leaves the vodka alone. I bet he drank one-two bottles before heading out. He got lucky that there weren't any real mutants waiting for him. So here's my advice, mate: don't drink too much.</text>

I used my binoculars to see what was it. And there, on the roof of some building, were several poltergeists, making noises. And when the lightning would strike at them from time to time, they would moan louder. One of the veterans told me that it's their way of eating. Interesting, isn't it?</text>

There were wires leading from every pod to a computer that was nearby. Stalkers that found the lab somehow managed to turn it on. As they turned it on, the words flashed on the screen: "Consciousness can't be found. Please, plug in working objects". I don't know what scientists there tried to achieve, but I think it's a good thing that they weren't successful. Who knows, maybe they were building another «Brainscorcher».</text>

		<text>The hunters told me one story. They were hired to kill a bloodsucker that was bothering the stalkers. They made their preparations and eventually found mutant's lair. They check their surroundings and come inside during the day, while the mutants is asleep. The lair was an old house. They entered it and saw a bloodsucker sleeping while standing, like they always do, but he was also pressing something to his chest. Stalkers didn't want to give mutant any chance, so they just shot him dead. Then they came closer to see what he was holding. It was a child's painting. They looked around and saw many other paintings like that. And all paintings contain a family. Ever since then, stalkers believe that humanoid mutants have some memory about their past life still left in them. That's kinda sad, to be honest. Maybe the burers, controllers, bloodsuckers and others that we're killing like a beasts, once were a good people... Zone is such a bitch...</text>

He walked around the hunter and attacked him from behind, but stalker was fast enough to shoot. Though he didn't kill the mutant and it ran off. Hunter ran after him, but tripped and dislocated his shoulder. He couldn't fight like this, so he returned to the camp. After a few days as his shoulder got fixed, he went on a hunt once again. This time he paid attention to every sound, his rifle ready. He followed the same trail, and suddenly he heard a noise behind him. Stalker turns around, raises his gun, but realised it was just a stone falling down. But why did the stone just fall? Hunter realised that something was off. He turns back and sees a bloodsucker flying towards him. Stalker jumps to the side, mutant flies past him. He shot and this time he got it good. He took his trophy and return to camp, where he told everyone what happened. Everyone got surprised - are mutants capable of such tricks? Ever since, hunters prefer to complete their hunt in one go. These mutants won't make the same mistake twice.</text>

They finished exploring and decided to go back, when suddenly they heard small footsteps. They got alarmed, thought it was a karlick. Suddenly, from one of the classrooms, a weird, dunno how to call it, child's figure comes out. It looked like a child's shadow, and it just stood there. Stalkers couldn't move a muscle. This shadow looked like a small girl in a school uniform. This "girl" grabbed a toy from the floor and suddenly threw it at the stalkers. They got scared and ran outside. They never returned to that place again. Though, I think it all was just their imagination. What "shadows"? That school is a big psy-zone, no wonder that they saw things. And about the flying toy - it was probably a poltergeist or a burer. They love throwing stuff.</text>

For each shot crow they would pay you, and they only gave a limited time to shoot. But the thing is, you would use your own gun, and your own ammo. It just wasn't worth it at all - you would waste more money on ammo than you'd get. Only a few stalkers could make profit from it. Many couldn't even return the money they paid in the start. It was basically a scam.</text>

		<text>Have you ever heard about the «Night King»? It was a very dangerous bloodsucker that lived somewhere deep in the Zone. Hunters that killed it told me that it would ignore any bullets - like it was invulnerable. It killed half of their group before one of the hunters shot it with under-barrel grenade launcher. Only then the bloodsucker got blown to pieces. And what's interesting - they found a «Night star» artefact inside him. Maybe he swallowed it, maybe it was somehow implanted inside him, but it seems that the artefact was the reason why the bloodsucker didn't care about the bullets.</text>

And all of them were just standing there, sleeping... Soldiers almost shot at them, but they hold their fire. They acted smart: mined the storehouse and put a machine gun at the distance. When everything was ready - they blew up the explosives and opened fire to kill anyone who survived the explosion. They killed every last of these sucking mutants without any casualties. So, be careful when exploring buildings - who knows, maybe you've stumbled upon bloodsucker's sleepover.</text>

And it weren't the only things he could do. It could also create illusions. And when stalkers shot at those illusions, they would split into more. Stalkers were able to figure out which one of them was the real one and killed him. They have never returned to that underground again.

Suddenly - the polter fucking punches him! Stalker fell down and didn't get up anymore. Averyone panicked, while the poltergeists began to crawl towards them. Their heads started to hurt while the items on the ground began to fly towards them. And not just items - poltergeist even threw bodies at them. Stalkers opened fire and killed the mutant before he would kill them all. Though, they still lost one more guy - polter hit his head with a wooden box.

And because of that, many stalkers think that the top of his head is his face. The mutant wears an old black coat. And this mutant will attack only in defence.

Eggheads wanted samples of this mutant for their research so they hired a Duty squad. Dutyers gathered their things and went to the factory. People say that the shooting was so loud that no one could sleep. And when everything went silent, the survived dutyers left the factory in hurry. Some of them were dragging mutant's body on a tarp, while others were carrying their dead comrades. When stalkers inspected the factory later, it looked like a battle field. Wreckage lying around, part of the roof fell. Piles of bullet casings laying around like in a shooting range. Blood, pieces of flesh everywhere. A bloody mess. I doubt that the job was worth it.

He called his creation a «Hermosuit» and went on his journey to Radar. Some time later, stalkers found his body between the abandoned cars that was radioactive as fuck.

Commander ordered to recalculate their inventory to know what exactly is missing. And the thing is - the storage was locked for good, and our night thief wasn't able to get inside, but somehow they were two vests short.

		<text>Did you know that anomalies can change items in some weird ways? For example, if a suit happens to fall into an anomaly without being turned into useless crap instantly, it may gain a very useful properties after some time. For example, stalkers found an unusual «Sunrise» suit inside the whirligig anomaly. This suit could repel bullets. No, it wouldn't save you if you'd get shot right in the chest, but if the bullet would fly towards your, let's say, arm, or shoulder, or kidney, it would get repelled. Stalkers named that suit «Enchanted Sunrise». Tho it's unclear how to throw a suit into an anomaly to get the needed effect.</text>

		<text>Did you know that Wolf had box of dynamite before? I don't know, why would he need it, but after some time that he got it, dutyers launched an attack at Freedom's base by blowing up one of the walls.

		<text>I heard a story from Wolf, that once a rookie got robbed by bandits somewhere at the Cordon, they also took his gun. That rookie was very angry for a while, then he somehow got himself an AK and ran to the ATP to get his revenge. The shooting started and ended in a couple of minutes. No one saw that rookie since then. Moral of the story - do not overestimate your powers, and don't seek stupid revenge.</text>

		<text>You know that dutyers like to test those who wish to join them, right? I heard that there was a sergeant named Plichko, he liked to come up with weird tasks. Once, he ordered a rookie to get inside the abandoned hangar territory and check if there's any documentation left. The thing is, that hangar was full of «Burnt Fuzz», and the only way to entry was through the roof. Well, the rookie really wanted to be a Duty member, so he went on to do the job. Day has passed - he didn't return. Well, Plichko sent two dutyers to go and check what happened - maybe the stalker found something valuable and ran. Dutyers climbed on top of the hangar and saw large hole in it's roof. They look down - a piece of roof is laying on the ground, and stalker's body is hanging in the «Burnt Fuzz» with horror written on his face. Dutyers got terrified of such death, they reported the incident to the higher ranking officers. It wasn't the first time when Plichko sent a rookie to his death, so he lost his rank. And that is that.</text>

		<text>Once a Freedom sniper started to shoot out the dutyers. He climbed on top of water tower not far away from bar «100 Rads» and shoot at every dutyer in sight. And every time someone closed in on him - he just disappeared. It was long before Duty moved their base closer to the bar. By doing that, sniper didn't let the dutyers that were sitting in the bar to return to their base. Dutyers hired an experienced stalker, he set an ambush on the sniper. It seems that freedomer didn't expect non-dutyer to kill him.</text>

		<text>Have you ever heard of a guy named Borov, the one who was bandit's leader before? Well, someone killed him, and many thought that it was because of conflict between bandits, but I heard something more interesting. Some people say that it was Voronin who paid a stalker who was working for them to kill Borov. It all happened because bandits catched a dutyer who was carrying documents about X-18 laboratory back to the base. Hired stalker made his way into bandit base without raising any suspicion, killed Borov, took the documents and fled to the Duty base. Voronin gave him rank of Duty veteran for that. Some people even say that it was Strelok himself, but I doubt that things like that would interest him.</text>

		<text>There was a sadistic bastard in Freedom ranks before, his name was Tyrant. They didn't kick him out because he was very skillful soldier. Once he was able to push his way into Wild Territory and capture the construction site with his squad. Dutyers spent a lot of time trying to kick him out of there, but they weren't successful. Then Voronin sent one experienced veteran to deal with it. And can you believe that - he sole handedly killed whole Tyrant's group, including him. After that Voronin promoted him to «Keeper of Duty» rank. Some people say that it was Strelok, but I don't believe that. Why would a loner help Duty?</text>

		<text>One day, General Voronin, the leader of Duty, hired an experienced stalker to do a very important job - kill Lukash, the leader of Freedom. Stalker was meant to make his way into Freedom's base unnoticed, kill Lukash without making any noise and return with his PDA. But Freedomers aren't stupid - they know each other, and when they saw a freedomer that no one knew - they instantly realised what was going on. I don't know if the stalker ran away or died there - there's no information on that. But as we all know, Lukash is still alive and well.</text>

But... if there's a power, there's a corruption, right? Well, you could pass for one-two thousands of rubles, or if you would do something for them. For example, shoot mutant pack and bring the trophies. It's good that now you can pass freely. They really were acting more like bandits before.</text>

		<text>Some time ago, there was a group of killer veterans camping in Wild Territory. They robbed and killed loners that were passing by. Right under Duty's nose! And Voronin just ignored it - the leader of that group, Lucky, was the one who helped Duty to capture territory of the factory. But Voronin knew that this shit can't go on, so he hired one stalkekr through Barkeep to deal with it, so that if he won't be successful, no one would know that it was Duty who hired him. Stalker attacked Lucky's group at night and killed them all. Dutyers don't like to talk about that story - and I'm not surprised, who would like to admit that they were friends with maniacs.</text>

Professor Kruglov was on that helicopter and he carried very important information. The helicopter fell down, but Kruglov and few peopel survived. Mercs surrounded them and were ready to shoot them all, when a stalker appeared from behind and killed every last of them. Can you imagine? They say that stalker was Strelok himself. I won't be surprised if it's true - he's not called that for nothing.</text>

When stalkers found him, he was mumbling that he saw "it" and that "it" is now inside his head. He screamed that no one should go to the North. He talked about his daughter. Then he asked stalkers that found him to take the artefact he was holding and carry it to the Barkeep so that he would compensate something to his family. After stalkers took the artefact, Falcon suddenly ran straight into «Meatgrinder». Looks like Scorcher "burned" him after all. Sad story, he was a good stalker.</text>

		<text>Dutyers have a weird habit to order the killing of their enemies from loners. For example, general Voronin once ordered Leshiy, the Freedom's guide. And what do we see today? Leshiy is alive and well. Not all loners are skilled. But dutyers can't hire mercs for that - they're at war with each other. Question - why won't they just send their own guy? That's because freedomer can feel a dutyer from a mile away.</text>

Everything went smooth and clean, and no one in Duty even flinched - they would be happy to get rid of him themselves if they would have a good reason to do so. Someone was put in his place, so there were no problems from his death.</text>

Once he was sent together with group of guys to scout the area deep in the Zone. When the group returned, Banana wasn't with them. They got in a shootout with monolithians, few of them died. And right in the middle of the fight - a blowout happened. They ran towards the house that was nearby, all survivors were able to hide there. All, but Banana.

After Brain Scorcher was turned off, few years passed and Leshka went on his journey to the centre of the Zone, while Sevka stayed. Few days passed and then Brain Scorcher starts working again out of nowhere. Sevka got worried about his friend, so he started preparing for trip to the North. I don't know how he managed to pull it off, but he arrived at Zaton in one piece. There he met his friend - standing with other zombified stalkers. Tragic end. Sevka grieved for long time, he thought it was his fault. He hid his zombified friend in the cave and tied so that he wouldn't escape. When Brain Scorcher was turned off again - he hit the road to find the Wish granter. He said he wanted to make a wish to make Leshka human again. He was very naive.

When they caught him, they put him behind the bars in the Farm at the Cordon. They interrogated him again and again, where is the case - he never told them because he knew that his subordinates were going to free him. And he was right, military were planning a rescue operation, they even captured Vehicle station and set their base there. But stalkers hired an experienced mercenary to help them deal with the soldiers. After that Khaletskiy realised that no one will rescue him, so he gave up the coordinates of stash where he hid the case. Next day he disappeared. He killed two guards and ran. Everyone got suspicious of third guard and the mercenary - everyone knows mercs like to work for both sides to get paid more. Ever since, no one saw Khaletskiy again.

He studied the behaviour of the mutants and wrote everything in his PDA. He had very good knowledge of any mutant kind, if you needed - he could tell you their weak points and habits. He had a theory that mutants are migrating from one corner of the Zone to other, just like normal animals. He recorded all cases of stalkers meeting with certain type of rare mutants. Once he noticed that mutants that he was tracking were vanishing somewhere between Great Swamps and Yantar. Then he decided to check Agroprom's Undergrounds to check if they had some sort of "transit point" there. He never returned. Later, when dutyers sent a mercenary down there to deal with some other mission, he found Losev's body and took his PDA.

By the way, he only had one hand, and his legs were partly broken, making him unable to move very much. He always sat with a shotgun in his hand - maybe he felt at ease this way, or he just liked the gun. People say he used stalkers like expendable material, many rookies died because of him. He had a deal with military, just like Sidorovich does, so they weren't shooting at stalkers. But as the time went on, the relations between a group of stalkers and military worsened, a shootout happened. After that, military reinforced their posts and started to shoot those who came too close. Toad didn't appreciate that, it hurt his business, and the place weren't safe anymore, so he moved deeper into the Zone. But as far as I know, he died there.

One soldier fixed an old Zaporozhets - Maximenko sent him to the catacombs and took the car for himself. Funny enough, it led to his death - he was riding around the institute and crashed into bulldozer.</text>

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_179">
		<text>I heard that there was a stalker that lived in the Agroprom, they called him Ratter. He wasn't called that for nothing - he worked in Kiev's zoo before, and in the Zone he started to train rats and breed them. Then he would sent them through the collector into Agroprom Undergrounds, where they would annoy the military. Well, people also say he was a bit crazy, like, he talked with the rats. Well, it's the Zone - there are all kinds of people here.</text>

		<text>Did you know, that Liolik, Garry and Zhorik are brothers? They even wear the same clothes, although Liolik doesn't like his brothers, he almost hates them - won't even talk. It seems that's why he's working in the Arena instead of Bar.</text>

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_181">
		<text>You know that after Brain Scorcher was turned off, many stalkers moved North, right? Lesha Jaw was one of those guys, he was a stalker veteran. He led the group of seven people to the Radar. Lesha didn't like to take risks, so he sent two guys by the names of Crowbar and Log to approach Pripyat and scout the area. Time passed, they haven't returned. One of the group members, Treasurer, got tired of waiting so he fled. But the thing is, he carried the "gold reserve" of the group on his PDA. Lesha realised that it's not safe to move out yet, so he turned his group around and they left. Crowbar and Log were found dead near Pripyat later. And for the Treasurer - he was eaten by mutants not far away.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_182">
		<text>One stalker told me this story. When he was a rookie, he and his friend found a spot with a lot of artefacts at the Garbage - the railroad tunnel. They went there several times and kept the place secret. As time went on, they noticed that bandits were wandering around more often. Then one time they had to hide in the tunnel so that bandits wouldn't see them. Suddenly, an emission happened, and the tunnel got filled with anomalies - stalkers were trapped. His friend decided to go deeper into the tunnel in order to find another exit, but he tripped and fell into anomaly. Other stalker sat near the old train, unsure what to do. Some time passed and another stalker was passing by the tunnel, he noticed him and helped him get out. After that, he returned to the Cordon and never went deeper into the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_183">
		<text>Did you know, that the first military group that was sent to Agroprom Undegrounds never made it back to the surface? Leader of the group was commander Petrovich, a skilled soldier. I heard that he was constantly complaining about his service, but he always followed the orders and completed all missions assigned to him. This was the first and the last mission he couldn't complete - his whole group died, including him. When diggers found his PDA, it contained an audio recording with description of the operation. When soldiers were descending into the catacombs, they stumbled upon a few mutants living there. After dealing with them, they looked around for any documents, but were unsuccessful. They found nothing and tried to leave, but while they were underground - an emission occurred, and now the exit was blocked by anomaly. They tried looking for another exit, but instead they found a controller that killed them all.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_184">
		<text>I heard a story about stalker called Polkan. He was a military stalker before, he completed many missions in Zone's deeps. During one of his mission, his whole group was killed, but he managed to survive. He managed to get the evidence that htey were set up - they were sent on impossible mission intentionally. Polkan staged his death and joined loners to get his revenge by the "laws of the Zone". But he wasn't successful - military somehow realised that he survived and hired someone to finish him off. Sadly, the justice did not prevail.</text>

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_185">
		<text>Did you know that bandits had a base in Agroprom before? They were sitting in the building that is now occupied by the military. To be fair though, they didn't have time to make the place comfy - military arrived with a couple of BTRs. But bandits knew that they were coming - part of them fled to the Dark Valley, other part made a camp at the Garbage, near the broken crane. And those stupid guys who stayed at the base - got shot.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_186">
		<text>Some people say, that when mercenaries just arrived at their new base in Dead City, they got attacked by two stalkers. They killed half of mercs that were there from the distance, then stormed the building where survivors were hiding. Only 7 mercs were there when it happened, their squad was guarding the supplies. It seems that those two stalkers somehow knew when there will be least amount of people in the base, and then attacked. Some say that they were hired by someone to search for an artefact. What artefact - I don't know.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_187">
		<text>This story I heard from Barkeep. One day, dutyers found a crazy stalker near the Radar. They brought him to the base, examined him for injures and started the interrogation. He didn't say a word. No, it's not like he was stubborn or something. His brains resembled a mush at that point - he was mumbling something non-stop, didn't react to anything. Then he said a name: Hunchback. Barkeep remembered that three stalkers visited the bar few days ago - Hunchback, Baldy and someone third. And Baldy was enjoying his drink in the bar right at that moment. Well, dutyers approached him, asked about his friends. He played dumb at first, but then he confessed - he, together with his friend Hunchback and Pock were sent on a mission to the Radar by ecologists. They were ready to depart, but they didn't have the information about Brain Scorcher periods of decline. Pock somehow managed to get that information and they moved out. As they were walking through the Radar, suddenly Brain Scorcher started to work at full. Pock grabbed his head and fell off the slope. Baldy wanted to ran away, but Hunchback insisted on saving their friend. Together they climbed down the slope, when suddenly Brain Scorcher hit them again. Baldy came to his senses when he already was sitting at the military base. He didn't know what happened to his friends. Baldy refused to talk with Pock, he felt guilty for leaving them. Dutyers returned to Pock, one of them pretended to be Baldy - when suddenly Pock got mad and started to blame him for his treachery and escape. Dutyer pretended that he wanted to return to the Radar and find Hunchback. Pock told him that he won't be coming, but he gave dutyer the flash drive with information about Brain Scorcher periods of decline. Suddenly, Pock grabbed his gun and blew his brains out. No one was able to stop him. Barkeep was angry that he had to clean the place, but the information they got from Pock was very useful for Duty.</text>

		<text>There was a stalker by the name of Sasha White. Ye, just like in the "Brigade". He was a stalker veteran and a master of explosives. For real, he had RPG-7y that he always carried on his back. He was one of the stalkers that were storming the Pripyat after Brain Scorcher was turned off. Sadly, their group was attacked by BTR, and Sasha died before he could fire his RPG. He was a good stalker...</text>

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_189">
		<text>I heard that before there was a maniacal sniper at the Garbage. He lived in the railway tunnel and left it during the day to shoot everything that moves. Stalkers had many problems because of him, but no one could shoot him down - he was a skilled veteran. Then stalkers got the idea to attack him at night - and they did so. But the sniper set up a wired trap at the entrance, and one of the stalkers blew himself up. Sniper woke up, a fight started, few more stalkers died, but they managed to kill the bastard.</text>

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_190">
		<text>I bet you heard how the military searched the X-18 lab, right? I heard that something went wrong during the search and the group didn't return. They sent another squad down there, and they found a crazy soldier that was wandering around the lab and shooting everything that moves. Well, of course, they had to shoot him. Judging by the things, that soldier went crazy either from fear, or because something got to his brains - then he shot his own group members. And... Don't ask me how do I know about it, okay? Let's say I got my own sources.</text>

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_191">
		<text>Did you know that stalker named Senior was leader of Freedom before Lukash? I don't know much about him, but it doesn't matter. After Senior died, there were two claimants for his place - Lukash and Murk. Murk was Senior's successor and no one even questioned that he will take his place. But everything went on differently as you might have guessed. Murk had to leave the base for personal reasons, and Lukash used it to his advantage. Having his buddies back him up, he took Senior's spot, and what's funny enough, no one said a word. When Murk returned, he was unpleasantly surprised by his new commander. But he had no grounds to take Lukash's place, so he had no choice but to accept his new leadership.</text>

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_192">
		<text>Did you know, that mercenaries once took Doctor hostage in Dead City? They made their way into the Foggy Swamps where Doctor used to live before and caught him at night. I don't know what did they want from the old man, but they carried him back to their base and put him behind the bars. I'm not sure how did Doctor manage to escape, I heard he used a moment when military attacked the mercs, but after that he settled somewhere at the Great Swamps.</text>

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_193">
		<text>I bet you've already heard about the legendary Cartographer. He is Forester's friend and he was making mappping the areas since first days of the Zone. But exploring Spatial anomalies always was his favourite hobby. He had strong intuition that helped him to exit them. I even heard that he had a hideout inside one of those anomalies.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_194">
		<text>Did you know, that legendary Cartographer has a hideout in one of the Spatial anomalies? I heard that you can't get there unless you have a special key. That key consists of several parts, and each part was hidden by Cartographer inside different factions territories, so that if they could use it only when they stop their meaningless war and unite for common purpose. What purpose is that - I don't know.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_195">
		<text>Have you ever heard about Cartographer? He's something like a legend. I heard that he avoids other stalkers by moving through Spatial anomalies. Even though he's old, he's very mobile. If someone would try to bother him for some nonsense - he would get very angry.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_196">
		<text>I bet you've heard about Black Digger, right? There are rumours that Fang, the member of Strelok's group, is the one who's responsible for his death. That Fang ordered some rare details from Black Digger, but he didn't like the price. Then he pretended to agree on the deal, and together they moved to Black Digger's hideout, then Fang killed him. After that he took the details he needed and ran off. How do I know all this? You see, when diggers noticed that Black Digger haven't been in a camp for a while, they scouted the area and finally found his secret hideout. There they found dead digger, and the hideout was a total mess, like if someone was searching for something. Then diggers asked stalkers about who they saw recently, and several stalkers said that they saw Fang in the camp. Then the rumours started, but no one was able to find Fang to confirm.</text>

		<text>Heard any news around here lately?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_1">
		<text>Like what?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_10">
		<text>What do you think about Nimble?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_101">
		<text>Nimble? I think that one of these days we'll jump that slippery jackass in a quiet place!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_11">
		<text>You hear anything about the Oasis?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_111">
		<text>Well, I heard a funny story once. Basically, the boys at Garbage started a rumour about where the Oasis is, and made it real believable, too. Then, they went to that location and waited. Well, what can I say? So many gullible losers showed up to share their stuff that the boys who started the whole thing left the Zone soon afterwards. And why not? Fellas were set for life. Only one of them stayed behind, some guy called Yoga...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_112">
		<text>That if you go there all your problems will be solved... I reckon that's gotta be handy - no more hangovers or haemorrhoids has gotta be good! Find it, set up a resort and let the cash pile up.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_113">
		<text>Why would I bother listening to that crap? All it is, is cheap talk for losers... Real men don't believe that shit. You know, you're sitting in a bar with a cold one in your hand and the stalkers are buzzing all around, arguing over where the Oasis is. And every one of those suckers swears he knows the location... Though for some reason it differs from sucker to sucker.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_12">
		<text>Ever meet a stalker called Magpie?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_121">
		<text>Sure have... One look at him told me he was a complete sucker and then I heard stalkers saying he's total scum, too. I don't know where he is though... You'll have to find him yourself if you're after him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_122">
		<text>Nah... First time I've heard that name, buddy.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_13">
		<text>Do you know who could have stolen things from a personal box?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_131">
		<text>A rat. I reckon you'd better ask the bosses over at Yanov, 'cause they're known for hunting a rat down.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_14">
		<text>Who could help me with decrypting something here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_141">
		<text>Well, I heard Nitro at Yanov is good. Apparently, back when he wasn't working for Duty the boys got him to crack stalker PDAs a couple of times... Ah, the good old days...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_143">
		<text>Don't get all scientific on me, chief. You're gonna need a hacker for that shit. Back when I was doing time I met one in the can but that's the only one I know. When I got out he still had about a fiver left...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_15">
		<text>I have the Duty trader's PDA. You know anyone who would be interested in it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_151">
		<text>There's a trader at Skadovsk called Owl. He pays pretty good and the boys sell him stalker PDAs now and again. He doesn't ask too many questions either, so it's all good.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_152">
		<text>Just about anyone, buddy. Think about it: his own faction will bury the cocksucker alive, other factions will kick up a fuss, but Owl at Zaton would make that PDA disappear real good. Only thing is, only Owl knows where that PDA will turn up later on... It's up to you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_16">
		<text>Where can I find tools around here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_165">
		<text>Well, if you need surgical tools I'd look in hospitals and emergency stations. If you're looking for construction tools, then check by the quarry at Jupiter. If it's small tools you're after, then search old workshops.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_166">
		<text>How the hell should I know? I don't need tools to convince stalkers to cough up, just so you know... Relax, I'm just kidding.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_17">
		<text>Who can unblock a memory module?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_171">
		<text>Good question! I mean that's what I specialize in, right? Hah! Are you dumb, buddy? It's either gonna be technicians or scientists... You don't really think I deal with that kind of shit, do you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_172">
		<text>I'll be honest with you: the last time I unblocked memory modules was back at school and the memory module was a friggin' floppy disk. Go talk to the experts and bust their balls about it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_18">
		<text>Who could break into a steel container?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_181">
		<text>Know Cardan from Skadovsk? Well, he got wasted the other day and started chasing this asshole around the place with a jimmy. I reckon Cardan could use that jimmy for more useful purposes and crack stuff if you needed.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_182">
		<text>Well, with the right tools even I could do it, but then who drags equipment into the Zone with them? Visit the technicians, buddy - they're good at that kind of thing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_19">
		<text>I'm looking for a stalker called Snag. Do you know where I can find him?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_191">
		<text>Who knows? Ask Sultan at Skadovsk. The boss usually knows where all the dupes are at.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_193">
		<text>Yeah, I've heard of that loser. He normally hangs around at Zaton, so you won't find him around here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_2">
		<text>Do you know anything about the crashed helicopters?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_20">
		<text>Who might be interested in information about Duty's founder?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_201">
		<text>I don't know anyone who wouldn't be interested! That's explosive info, buddy, so your best bet is to go through Owl at Skadovsk - that way you'll get some cash but won't make any enemies.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_22">
		<text>No. Think about it, I've got Duty on the left, Freedom on the right and stalkers up my ass - and you expect me to keep my eyes on the sky?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_23">
		<text>Well, the boys said they spotted one swinging on the cables in Iron Forest, but you're gonna see a lot more than that out there... You're bound to run into an anomaly or get your skull crushed by a poltergeist.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_24">
		<text>Yeah, some fellas saw one crash onto a plateau but the thing is there's no way up there... they said it was flyin' so weird it looked like the pilot had popped a pill or something.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_26">
		<text>I heard a chopper went down, right into swamp water. It ran aground pretty quick and the water there is not exactly good for your health either - poison, chemicals and shit.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_3">
		<text>You saw any military around?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_30">
		<text>Who could be interested in maps of the area between Zaton and Jupiter?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_301">
		<text>Pilot, I reckon - he's the main guide around those parts. It would be good if he had some maps instead of using the stars like he's doing now...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_31">
		<text>The boys said that an army squad went down the southern plateau straight for the mercenary camp. They figured that the shit was about to kick off, so they left in a hurry.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_32">
		<text>I heard this story of how the army cockroaches were trying to get some shit out of their crashed chopper in the swamp. Imagine that, five army boys in uniform jumping around in a swamp trying not to get wet...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_33">
		<text>One fella told me how he was following a stalker to get a piece of his loot when he heard gunshots and shit. Turned out the army were fighting the mercs. He hid and waited the firefight out, but by that time the stalker had run off. Tough luck, huh?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_34">
		<text>Well, a bro told me about witnessing a pretty funny scene. Imagine that barge with a mill on top and Noah yapping away next to it, all fired up and shit, and ten army boys trying to get as far away from Noah's dog as possible. Well, my bro had himself a good laugh and left the circus to its own devices.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_35">
		<text>Nah, this is a pretty dodgy place, full of fellas with powered up shooters and shit... I ain't got the time to check which are military and which are Duty on a mission.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_4">
		<text>Do you know how to get to Pripyat?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_40">
		<text>Who could I hire to protect the scientists?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_403">
		<text>Hah, me and the boys will do the job! We'll give them protection like they ain't never seen! Stalkers and mutants will be shit scared to go anywhere near the friggin' place, trust me! Cough up the dough every week, and we're all yours. And don't forget a Christmas bonus!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_41">
		<text>By walking, buddy. Walk on over towards Jupiter and ask your questions there, 'cause there's no direct route from Zaton to Pripyat and that's a scientific fact.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_43">
		<text>Hey buddy, do I look like a guide or what? I mean, is there a tattoo on my forehead that says 'Ask stupid questions here' or something? Go ask Pilot, he's paid to answer questions about that shit.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_44">
		<text>No... What would I do there anyways? There ain't no stalkers to rip off there!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_5">
		<text>Can you suggest anyone that's not too tied down who'd be willing to make a move for Pripyat?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_51">
		<text>Pripyat ain't no place for guys like us. Think about it, it's full of mutants and anomalies... like the rest of the Zone... but without stalkers and their loot. When stalkers show up in Pripyat, give us a shout and we'll head on over there to maintain the natural order of things.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_57">
		<text>No idea, buddy. Sorry.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_6">
		<text>I found an unusual shooter. Do you know anyone who might know something about it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_62">
		<text>Well, I'd ask the technicians. I mean, it's their business to know this shit, right?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_63">
		<text>Beats me, but stalkers from Skadovsk believe that Cardan is a technical genius or something. Talk to him if you want... He's just an old drunk if you ask me...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_7">
		<text>Who could I hire to take measurements for the scientists?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_73">
		<text>That's an easy one - our boys will do it. I mean they didn't go to school or anything, but they'll take whoever you want and measure them real good. Once they have the measurements, all they need is a nice grave and that's no problem either!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_8">
		<text>I found a very strange artefact. Can you suggest a buyer?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_81">
		<text>A strange artefact, you say? Let's have a look at it... Hand it over so I can see it better... Hah, relax buddy - I'm just kidding, but if I were you I'd keep that kind of thing out of sight. Others might not have such a good sense of humour.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_83">
		<text>You've got balls to be flashing that artefact around here. Respect. Here's the thing: the man to see for that shit is Beard over at Skadovsk. We don't know how he's getting the artefacts out of the Zone yet, so you should be able to sell yours no problem.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_9">
		<text>I found a whole bloodsucker lair nearby. What are we gonna do?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_91">
		<text>Err, what's there to do? Run the hell away, that's what!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_98">
		<text>Okay, forget about it.</text>

		<text>You hear anything about the Oasis?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_111">
		<text>It's a stalker fairytale. That's what stalkers do: make up shit that ain't true and then all get together and search for it! I'd ignore that stuff if I were you. It's like a gateway myth: believe it and you'll believe that the Wish Granter exists before long.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_112">
		<text>Ah, that place where wounds heal by themselves and your energy is magically replenished? I got news for you, friend: it doesn't exist. Stalkers invent that crap to make the Zone sound less dangerous than it is, but the harsh reality is that there are no safe places in the Zone. And you gotta keep a firm grasp on that reality out here, buddy - dreamer types don't last long in the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_113">
		<text>Yeah, and all the artefacts there are worth their weight in gold and are presented to you on a silver platter while you're getting your feet rubbed... I'm joking, of course. I doubt it exists, although it would be nice if it did. We could even set up a hospital there without the need for any medics - folks could just show up there and heal...

		<text>Where can I find tools around here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_163">
		<text>There's a whole plant nearby. Of course, it may have already been looted by now, but I'd still check the plant warehouses if I were you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_165">
		<text>I'd start looking in the old workshops if I were you. You might also find something in stores.</text>

	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_169">

	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_22">
		<text>Yeah, our scouts saw a military helicopter descend towards the reserve pads by Jupiter. They said they kept signalling them to change course but I guess the pilots had other things to worry about. I wonder if the army boys managed to get out of the mine field okay.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_23">
		<text>Not around here, no. Our presence here is limited... try asking our boys near Yanov.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_25">
		<text>Our patrol reported that a military helicopter attempted a crash landing near the Jupiter plant. Unfortunately, the chopper crashed right into the roof above the workshops. There are probably no survivors - the patrol didn't receive any distress signals after the crash.</text>

	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_301">
		<text>Someone who has some use for them. I'm talking about Pilot - he's a guide on the route between Yanov and Skadovsk, so he'd find those maps useful, that's for sure.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_31">
		<text>Military? I've not seen any around here, but we don't spend much time in this area.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_35">
		<text>A soldier's corpse was spotted in the mine field recently. He's probably one of the fellas that flew in in that chopper. The chopper carries up to eight people in addition to the crew, so they must have found a way out, though nobody knows where they went.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_36">
		<text>A military fella was seen at the scientists' bunker, and he only got there recently. I don't know the details.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_37">
		<text>Some guy in military uniform was seen entering a building by the Volkhov AA complex the other day. It's quite possible that it was just a zombie mistaken for a soldier though.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_38">
		<text>Stalkers spotted a military unit near Jupiter plant. Judging by the description it was special forces. They were accompanied by an unidentified stalker and headed towards Pripyat. This sounds reliable, but experience shows that information like that usually can't be trusted.</text>

	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_402">
		<text>Nah. While they've got Freedom people working for them, we'll stay well away from that place. Listening to those idiots crack their shitty jokes all day long is a fate worse than death.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_42">
		<text>Duty has no reason to look for a way to Pripyat at the moment, but we're collecting information anyway. There are unconfirmed reports that tunnels under the Jupiter plant lead to Pripyat. Checking this information would require searching everything in the plant area thoroughly.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_43">
		<text>No. If you need that kind of information you'll have to speak to a civilian guide - our scouts have enough on their plates as it is.</text>

		<text>Our scouts regularly check the area for safe paths to Pripyat, but that hasn't yielded any results as yet.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_5">
		<text>Can you suggest anyone that's not too tied down who'd be willing to make a move for Pripyat?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_51">
		<text>Duty's presence in this area is limited. Speak to our people at Yanov.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_52">
		<text>There's a rumour that the scientists have a military guy in their bunker. He hasn't got much of a way out, though. You see, the scientists are there for twelve to eighteen months, and he's not going to get to the edge of the Zone on foot and on his own. Considering that, I bet he'd be interested.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_53">
		<text>I suggest you look among people who're after adventures. For example, there's a stalker called Vano over at Yanov station. He doesn't care what kind of shit he gets himself into, and he could be useful - that boy can find a way through an anomaly with his eyes closed.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_54">
		<text>Well, you could start a recruitment campaign in a mental hospital... Then again, I know a good alternative - Monolith fighters. Speaking of which, a squad of them was spotted near AA complex, and they probably even know the way to Pripyat, too... Hey man, I hope you're not taking me seriously...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_56">
		<text>Look for volunteers in Duty. Strider, for example. He hasn't got a mission yet, so I figure the Lieutenant Colonel might let him go with you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_57">
		<text>Everyone knows that Duty's got the best fighters... but we've got other objectives at the moment.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_6">
		<text>I found an unusual shooter. Do you know anyone who might know something about it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_62">
		<text>Well, I'll be! That's some cannon! Did you make it yourself or did you really find it? I've never seen anything like it... Ask the technicians.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_7">
		<text>Who could I hire to take measurements for the scientists?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_71">
		<text>That's a dumb question - Duty, of course. We've got lots of folks with experience, and we've worked with the scientists before. Go see Lieutenant Colonel Shulga - I'm sure he'll find a squad for the job.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_72">
		<text>Who'd want to work there if the bunker is protected by Freedom? Those friggin' pacifists are so stoned most of the time they're just as likely to shoot each other as the enemy.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_8">
		<text>I found a very strange artefact. Can you suggest a buyer?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_81">
		<text>Artefacts are all strange and I wouldn't advise carrying it on you either. Hand it over to the experts and be done with it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_83">
		<text>You should show that thing to stalkers - they're experts in that kind of shit. Better still, show it to the person they sell their artefacts to.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_9">
		<text>I found a whole bloodsucker lair nearby. What are we gonna do?</text>

	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_91">
		<text>Duty squads are not currently engaging in purging operations in this area, so the lair will have to wait.</text>

		<text>Heard any news around here lately?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_1">
		<text>Like what?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_10">
		<text>What do you think about Nimble?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_101">
		<text>I've not heard much about him... You'd best ask the stalkers, he's one of them, ain't he?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_11">
		<text>You hear anything about the Oasis?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_111">
		<text>Loads... A nice story, I'll give you that. A palace in the sands, an island in the mist, a castle in the sky... Shangri La, Eden... the Oasis. Every free person has a dream and I don't blame 'em for it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_112">
		<text>Well, I did hear an interesting story from this one stalker. I think he was the first person to mention the Oasis to me. He said that according to legend, all your wounds heal there and you become calm and relaxed, as if you're not in the Zone at all. I haven't seen him since... It was only after he left that I remembered that he used to walk with a limp, but when he left he walked straight and looked like he'd gotten a hell of a lot younger.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_113">
		<text>Yes, free stalkers gave me the coordinates... Ten different sets of coordinates. Putting them together gives us an area from the Scorcher to the CNPP with the Yanov bar somewhere near the centre. It's entirely possible that we're in the Oasis right now, so enjoy it!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_12">
		<text>Ever meet a stalker called Magpie?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_121">
		<text>Nah. I don't know many free stalkers around here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_122">
		<text>Magpie? Nah, but that's a cool name.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_13">
		<text>Do you know who could have stolen things from a personal box?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_131">
		<text>Nah, there's no one like that here. We've got folk who'll snatch a bite of your bread or a sip of your drink when you're not looking, but no outright thieves...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_14">
		<text>Who could help me with decrypting something here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_141">
		<text>I heard that Nitro at Yanov is a fan of combinations and algorithms. I'm not sure though, I've never really spoken to him - he's working for Duty, so he ain't got much time for us free folk.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_143">
		<text>I'm not much of an expert on local experts... Ask our boys over at Yanov next time you're there - they'll know for sure.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_15">
		<text>I have the Duty trader's PDA. You know anyone who would be interested in it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_151">
		<text>That sounds interesting! I'd give it to Loki, our leader at Yanov. He'll make sure that free stalkers know what kind of folk Duty recruit into their ranks.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_16">
		<text>Where can I find tools around here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_163">
		<text>At the plant, dude, where else? It's not exactly lively in there, but the warehouses will cheer you up. It's a bit safer and you're bound to find some decent tools in there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_165">
		<text>That's a good question, man. Let's think about this one. Where do you find tools outside the Zone? Now, if you got half a brain, you buy them in a store... If you don't, you look for the tools and a brain in a workshop. Right? It's the same thing in the Zone - you have to look in the same places. It's that simple, stalker!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_166">
		<text>Tools? Listen, man, is that code for something? There're no pigs here or anything, you can speak freely... Oh, you're serious? In that case I really don't know.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_169">
		<text>Well, I heard that one of our boys was looking for tools, and he got into the train under the bridge. Apparently, there's a Tesla there... Anyway, he said it wasn't fun in there... Why am I telling you this? Well, he said he saw tools lying around, but decided to leave them 'cause it wasn't safe.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_17">
		<text>Who can unblock a memory module?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_171">
		<text>Well, Tukarev in the scientists' bunker can do it. He's fast, good and polite. There's also Nitro at Yanov, the Duty hanger-on. He's cheap and shitty, but he'll probably do the job.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_172">
		<text>A skilled technician, I guess. The local one is more about mechanical stuff, so unless you need your memory module's barrel rifled, I suggest you ask at Jupiter.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_18">
		<text>Who could break into a steel container?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_181">
		<text>Well, Cardan at Skadovsk is supposed to be good. People say he knows what he's doing, even though he's drunk most of the time. He might be able to help you crack that container.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_182">
		<text>Anyone who breaks into steel containers for a living? Nitro the local technician won't do, though. I hear he's more into breaking into other people's electronics.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_19">
		<text>I'm looking for a stalker called Snag. Do you know where I can find him?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_191">
		<text>Never heard of him... I'd ask other free stalkers if I were you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_2">
		<text>Do you know anything about the crashed helicopters?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_20">
		<text>Who might be interested in information about Duty's founder?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_201">
		<text>Loki, no question about it. He's our leader here at Yanov. Even if he doesn't know what to do with the info - the main thing is that Duty doesn't get its hands on it. Can you imagine how much propaganda bullshit that'll generate? I get a friggin' headache just thinking about it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_22">
		<text>Yeah, you heard that story about the chopper in the mine field? Basically, the jar-heads crashed onto the reserve landing pad which their fellow jar-heads mined six years back. Now some folks say they did it out of stupidity, but I figure there's more to it than that. Look at it like this: nobody is gonna go there, so once the army boys complete their mission they can return to the chopper, patch it up a bit and off they go. I'd love to know what their mission is...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_23">
		<text>I ain't a local buddy, I don't know shit. Pop in to see us at Yanov - our boys will tell you everything you want to know and everything you don't for good measure.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_25">
		<text>Yeah, some boys spotted a chopper flying real messy like the other day. It didn't land in a good place either - right onto one of the Jupiter roofs. The said it crashed and then went through the roof into the building, dragging all kinds of crap down with it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_3">
		<text>You saw any military around?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_30">
		<text>Who could be interested in maps of the area between Zaton and Jupiter?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_301">
		<text>Pilot for sure, man. He's the main free stalker guide around here - if you want to talk maps, he's the one you want.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_31">
		<text>Chill, dude. There ain't no cops, no jar-heads and no friggin' militia around here - you're as safe as can be in the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_35">
		<text>No, but some fellas told me they saw an army unit crawling through the mine field by the helipads. Those fellas thought about helping them but decided against it. The jar-heads are an unpredictable breed, you never know when they'll snap and shoot you in the back.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_36">
		<text>I ain't seen any myself but rumour has it that there's a jar-head at the scientists' bunker. Ozersky, the biologist, said that he's from that chopper which crashed into the plant... The joke doing the rounds is that the nerds have got themselves a pet soldier.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_37">
		<text>Not personally, but I heard some things from free stalkers. They said that a jar-head was spotted by the Volkhov AA complex. Gotta be a ghost or a zombie that's woken up... what do you reckon?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_38">
		<text>Nah. This one fella was sayin' that he saw seven soldiers following a free stalker past the radio plant towards Pripyat. There ain't been any weed in the Zone for a while, so I figure that's gotta be crazy talk, pure and simple.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_4">
		<text>Do you know how to get to Pripyat?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_40">
		<text>Who could I hire to protect the scientists?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_401">
		<text>Freedom, us in other words. We work with the scientists all the time, so guarding them would be piece of cake for us. Talk to our boss Loki over at Yanov - he'll agree for sure.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_402">
		<text>I ain't sure, friend, 'cause from what I've been hearing, the eggheads hired a Duty squad to work for them... We'd love to guard the scientists, but staring at those constipated Duty faces every day just ain't worth it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_42">
		<text>They say you can get there from Jupiter... I mean the plant, not the planet... Hah! That's a good one, you gotta admit!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_43">
		<text>You know, I ain't got a clue. Just can't find the time to go there... I'd ask Pilot in the camp, yeah? He's a free stalker and knows the area better than anyone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_44">
		<text>Bro, if I knew I'd have gone there a long time ago. Getting away from Duty, the jar-heads and all this fighting would be worth it...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_5">
		<text>Can you suggest anyone that's not too tied down who'd be willing to make a move for Pripyat?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_51">
		<text>Sorry, friend, I don't know anyone at Zaton... Take my advice and ask our boys at Yanov.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_52">
		<text>You know the scientists' bunker? Well, they've got a situation on their hands over there. First Garry, the stalker, decided to make for Pripyat and now the jar-head who's there got the same idea. Garry is a loner and proud of it, but that jar-head is exactly what you're looking for.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_53">
		<text>Vano at Yanov is as good as any. He's a decent fella and he could have joined Freedom any time if he wanted. I gather he ain't keen on our struggle with Duty... or any kind of struggle, for that matter. That's his view of things and we respect it!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_54">
		<text>Sure thing. One of our guys spotted a squad by the dry lake. They're bound to know Pripyat like the back of their hands, and they don't seem to be working for anyone. They're sure to be brave, too, 'cause they're Monolith fighters!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_55">
		<text>Yeah. Strider, the leader of our new recruits... it seems he feels uneasy in our ranks. His boys have adapted just fine, but he's not all that happy here... Speak to him - I hate to see a good man being where his heart don't lie...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_57">
		<text>Nah, no clue.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_6">
		<text>I found an unusual shooter. Do you know anyone who might know something about it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_62">
		<text>You didn't find a manual to go along with it, did you? No? No idea then.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_7">
		<text>Who could I hire to take measurements for the scientists?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_71">
		<text>I reckon our boys could do the job. Freedom has its share of smart folks and if we don't know something we'll ask at the bunker. We'd love the opportunity to help science! Speak to Loki at Yanov - I'm sure he'll say the same.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_72">
		<text>Me and the boys would love to do it, but Duty's guarding the bunker these days. Popping in to see the scientists is a problem as it is, but being there every day just wouldn't be healthy, that's for damn sure.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_8">
		<text>I found a very strange artefact. Can you suggest a buyer?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_81">
		<text>You need a collector, buddy. You won't find one at Yanov , seeing as even some stalkers are afraid of coming here. You'd best ask at Zaton, it's a bit quieter in those parts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_83">
		<text>You know Beard, the barman in the free stalker camp? He buys up artefacts and don't rip you off too much either. A nice fella, whichever way you look at it. It's a pity he don't work for us, really.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_9">
		<text>I found a whole bloodsucker lair nearby. What are we gonna do?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_91">
		<text>Man, you gotta warn the free stalkers - they've got their main camp around here, after all. The Zone's wildlife is valuable, to be sure, but I'm more concerned about the people in this place.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_98">
		<text>Okay, forget about it.</text>

		<text>You hear anything about the Oasis?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_111">
		<text>I've heard everything about the Oasis! It's a legend, a myth... every stalker expects something different from it and every damn one of them claims to know the exact location. It's a pity the only thing those locations have in common is that they're friggin' hard to reach.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_112">
		<text>Well, they say that wounds heal instantly there and your energy is replenished in minutes... They say no disease or sickness can last in the Oasis, not even radiation poisoning! The one thing I know for sure, though, is its whereabouts... Wanna know? It's in the centre of the Zone! But you gotta keep this between us, not a word to anyone!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_113">
		<text>I heard that any mutant you meet there will just walk on by without so much as looking at you. They also say that there's an artefact there called the Heart of the Oasis... Nobody knows what it does exactly, but one thing's for sure: you shouldn't touch it. Anyone who takes it won't have no place in the Zone no more... Location? Man, everyone knows it's in Pripyat under the Ferris wheel! I mean, where else would it be?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_12">

		<text>Nobody I know. Ask at Yanov - they've got an expert there of some kind.</text>

		<text>I have the Duty trader's PDA. You know anyone who would be interested in it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_151">
		<text>You know Owl at Skadovsk? I reckon he'd be glad to get his hands on it. He likes to get involved in sensitive business...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_152">
		<text>There used to be a fella called Owl on Skadovsk over at Zaton. He deals in information... your PDA might be of interest to him.</text>

	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_16">
		<text>Where can I find tools around here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_161">
		<text>A stalker told me that his old man was working in the substation workshops before 86. He said they had all kinds of equipment there, so I'm guessing there will be tools, too. It's probably all rusted to shit by now, but it might be worth a look anyway.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_162">
		<text>You know the sawmill in the wood on the hill? There should be some tools there, unless someone got to them first, that is. I doubt that, though: the closer you get to that place the more you feel like shitting your pants and running the hell away. It ain't even the radiation that's scary, I'll leave it at that...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_163">
		<text>Well, the Jupiter plant is right here and there's bound to be some tools in there. Personally, I wouldn't go near the plant itself... that place gives me the creeps. You could have a look in the Jupiter warehouses, the ones on the side of the plant.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_164">
		<text>I heard there's a couple of places in Pripyat where you can find all kinds of technical junk. One of them is supposed to be the old Soviet department store. It was pretty much the only place that had anything useful for sale back in the day.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_165">
		<text>How am I supposed to know? Check in old workshops or stores, there could be something usable there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_166">
		<text>To be honest, the last place I saw decent tools was in Sidorovich's bunker at the Cordon. Sure, you have to pay for them, but they're new and not all that expensive either.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_167">
		<text>You know, buddy, I didn't come to the Zone to search for tools. Think about it, how much use is a radioactive hammer?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_168">
		<text>I heard a rumour that you can pick up bits and pieces at the old service centre... You might be able to find tools there, too. But just as with anything else: the only way to get the good stuff is to get to it first.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_169">
		<text>Good question... I'd check in the old train under the bridge if I were you. Don't ask why... My gut tells me you might find something.</text>

	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_17">
		<text>Who can unblock a memory module?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_171">
		<text>Let me think... Well, Nitro at Yanov will be able to do it for sure. Other than that, there's also Tukarev, the scientists' technician and a real pro. You gotta think about what you want though, 'cause Nitro is a lot cheaper.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_172">
		<text>Well, you'll need a technician, but the only one around here is Cardan. Thing is, after that many years at the bottom of a bottle, he's not exactly safe around complex electronics. I'd ask around at Jupiter if I were you - they've got the right experts there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_18">
		<text>Who could break into a steel container?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_181">
		<text>Cardan at Skadovsk, I guess. I mean, the way he cuts through padlocks is a joy to watch.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_182">
		<text>A technician of some kind, I suppose. Nitro probably won't do it though - he's not into the rough stuff.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_183">
		<text>Hah, you're asking that in Pripyat?! Take my advice and look for someone a bit further away from the centre of the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_19">
		<text>I'm looking for a stalker called Snag. Do you know where I can find him?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_191">
		<text>Better ask Beard, the barman over at Skadovsk. He usually knows where stalkers are.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_193">
		<text>Snag? How the hell should I know? You'd best ask at Zaton, he hangs around there a lot of the time.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_2">
		<text>Do you know anything about the crashed helicopters?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_20">
		<text>Who's interested in information about Duty's founder?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_201">
		<text>I'd have a chat with Owl, the information trader at Skadovsk. You can bet your ass he'll be interested in credible info on a legend like that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_21">
		<text>I saw one myself... It didn't look like it crashed but it wasn't flying good either. It was swinging from side to side until it landed on a plateau in the south of Zaton... It'd be interesting to see whether anyone survived... If we only knew a way to get up there. Actually, I heard Noah from the psycho barge might know...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_22">
		<text>I heard about a few military choppers crashing not far from here... People say different things, but there's one I remember clearly. They said it landed on the reserve helipad that jar-heads themselves mined back in the day. Can you believe the irony in that shit? My old man used to say: 'Don't dig a hole for another, 'cause you'll be the one that falls in it.' True, ain't it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_23">
		<text>A buddy of mine told me this story... He went to the Iron Forest to get some artefacts and as soon as he got there he heard this crash behind him. He turned to see what it was and saw a chopper coming towards him at full speed, taking down pylons and shit on its way. He bolted the hell outta there... I'm surprised he made it out without landing in an anomaly. You won't have much trouble finding the Iron Forest - you can see it from miles off. It's full of friggin' poltergeists, too, so keep your wits about ya.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_24">
		<text>I heard one landed on the southern plateau but getting up there ain't easy. The other thing I heard is that someone spotted Noah on the edge of that plateau, which means that psycho knows a way of getting to it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_25">
		<text>I've not seen any myself but rumour has it that one crashed right into the plant... Nobody wants to check it out though - the place is just too dangerous.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_26">
		<text>One stalker told me he saw several military helis getting into some trouble... He saw the engine on one light up and then it went straight down into a swamp full of anomalies. You'll be able to get there easy enough, but the swamp itself is a friggin' nightmare... It's no place for humans, believe you me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_3">
		<text>You saw any military around?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_30">
		<text>Who could be interested in maps of the area between Zaton and Jupiter?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_301">
		<text>Pilot, who the hell else? He's a guide, you know? Constantly making trips between Skadovsk and Yanov, so he'll find a use for your maps sure enough.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_302">
		<text>This ain't Zaton or Jupiter, so these maps are useless here, right? Ask around in those places and you might have more luck!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_31">
		<text>I didn't see any myself but I heard a story about some soldiers getting down from the southern plateau on the sewerage works side. Apparently they tried to get down all proper at first, using cables and shit. But then gave up and slid down on their asses, hah! Zone bobsled - gotta love it!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_32">
		<text>I heard a conversation at Skadovsk about five or so jar-heads who were spotted coming out of a drainage tunnel by the swamp. They said the soldiers were dirty as hell, and one of them you couldn't even tell from a swamp bloodsucker, covered in slime from head to toe.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_33">
		<text>Not personally, but a friend of mine saw a military unit engage a group of mercs by the processing station. But by the time he found a nice spot to enjoy the show it was over 'cause the jar-heads fell back. No casualties on either side either... typical, ain't it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_34">
		<text>Apparently ten or so jar-heads were spotted hanging around Noah's barge. Now, given that the psycho was alive at this point, he probably came to some sort of agreement with them... which is just like him. Obviously nobody wanted to ask Noah about what happened - you never know what to expect from that crazy son of a bitch.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_35">
		<text>I heard something explode at night and then someone at Yanov told me that they saw a dead jar-head in the old mine field and an abandoned army chopper behind him. Seems they couldn't tell where they landed in the dark and went straight across the mines. Nobody knows how many of them made it out of there, but I doubt he flew that chopper in on his own.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_36">
		<text>I've not really seen any military... but I've heard rumours that a jar-head is hanging around with the scientists. The story goes that Garry, a stalker, found him when he went into the missile complex to look for his buddies. Now, the complex is crawling with zombies who aren't exactly friendly to stray humans, so Garry basically saved him from certain death.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_37">
		<text>No, but I heard that a jar-head was spotted by the Volkhov AA complex. I don't really believe it though... They could be lying or maybe they just can't tell a zombie from a soldier.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_38">
		<text>Military? Well, I heard people saying that 'a whole military unit lead by a stalker' was making its way past the Jupiter plant, but I didn't pay much attention to that gossip.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_4">
		<text>Do you know how to get to Pripyat?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_40">
		<text>Who could I hire to protect the scientists?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_401">
		<text>You know Spartacus and his squad? You know, the stalkers at Zaton? They're good people and decent fighters - they've been there, done that and got the T-shirt. I have a feeling they'd like the idea of guarding the scientists.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_402">
		<text>Did you run into Hatchet's squad by the substation workshops at Zaton? They've got their problems, like all mercs, but at least they ask questions first and shoot later. I'm guessing if you manage to sign them up for this job, the scientists will be pleased and stalkers can relax a little, too. Everyone's happy, right?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_403">
		<text>Erm... Nothing comes to mind... No, sorry.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_41">
		<text>What I know for sure is that there's no way of getting there from Zaton. Everyone who was bursting to get to Pripyat headed towards Jupiter, so you should ask around in those parts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_42">
		<text>Well, rumour has it that there are secret tunnels to Pripyat underneath the Jupiter plant... The thing is, these rumours usually get told after the second round, and then Jupiter is such a friggin' nightmare that nobody dares goes near it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_43">
		<text>How should I know, dude? You got any easier questions for me? All I can say is that you should find Pilot and talk to him - if anyone can help you, it's him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_44">
		<text>Hah, if I knew the way to Pripyat I wouldn't be here. Why do you think I went towards the centre of the Zone? Pripyat is full of artefacts, man! Whoever gets there first is gonna be living the high life!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_5">
		<text>Can you suggest anyone that's not too tied down who'd be willing to make a move for Pripyat?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_51">
		<text>I don't think there's anyone like that around here. Everyone who wanted to be closer to the centre of the Zone left for Jupiter. That's where I'd ask if I were you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_52">
		<text>You heard about the jar-head who's with the scientists at the moment? I reckon he ain't got much to lose by going with you. The scientists are not leaving any time soon, he can't reach the Cordon on his own, so he just might be dumb enough to go to Pripyat with you!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_53">
		<text>You know Vano over at Yanov station? He's an honest fella, a good stalker and gullible as hell. Now there's a cat who's better off around anomalies than people - so long as he's here there will always be someone to take advantage of him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_54">
		<text>Listen man, I heard that a squad was spotted by the dry lake south of the AA complex... Apparently they're not the usual stalkers or Freedom or Duty - they're Monolith men! So if you need someone to go to Pripyat with, they're just the ticket. Haha, you do realize I'm kidding, right?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_55">
		<text>You know Strider, the leader of the new Freedom squad? If you saw his miserable kisser, you'd know for yourself that Yanov ain't the place for him. You should try speaking to him. He might actually go for it.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_71">

	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_72">
		<text>You heard of Grizzly, Torba and Mitay, the stalkers at Yanov? They work as a trio, and they're shit hot! I think they're right for that kind of work... as long as Mitay has managed to stay out of trouble for once.</text>

		<text>I found a very strange artefact. Can you suggest a buyer?</text>
	</string>

	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_83">
		<text>I'd show it to Beard, the barman at Skadovsk. They say he works with collectors from the outside world and those cats always go nuts for strange stuff.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_27">

	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_502">
		<text>Hell should I know? I ain't been here long myself... You'd best ask at Zaton, our brothas there do their own networking.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_502">
		<text>Nah, no one's coming all the way out here with an extra suit like that... You'd better ask at Zaton - a step closer to civilization.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_503">
		<text>I have no idea where you'd look for one... Suits like that are rare even among Duty members. They issue 'em only for special distinction in battle or running operations in highly anomalous areas.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_502">
		<text>A good question, man... We don't ever wear those here in Freedom... I'd ask stalkers at Zaton if I were you. There might be someone there who runs that sort of business.</text>

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_1">
		<text>Do you know about a place called the Foggy Swamps? People say that it's located to the west of Dead city. Though it's almost impossible to get there now. Doctor lived there before, by the way. Now there's always military choppers patrolling the area - you can't even get close. You may try going through the bushes, but it's full of mutants. From fleshes down to chimeras. You better not go in there, at least for now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_2">
		<text>Do you know about the Dark Stalker? Some people say that he is an anomaly somewhere in the Foggy Swamps. He appears from the evaporations and attacks anyone who dares to step on his territory. Though, the military are still sitting in those swamps. How would they be able to be there with something like that right under their nose?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_3">
		<text>Did you ever hear about the mutant called «phantasm»? They say it looks like a flying brain with one eye and small claws. It could create phantoms to protect itself, just like a controller does. But those phantoms are not easy to kill, in fact, you can't kill them at all - if you shoot at them, they just split into more. The only way to deal with it is to kill the phantasm.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_4">
		<text>I heard one story, about dutyers hunting a very rare mutant - phantasm. It was like a flying brain that creates illusions. They say it lived in the Foggy Swamps before the military settled there. It made a lot of troubles for the people around, so dutyers sent a group and killed it. And right after it became safe there - military arrived and settled their base.</text>

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_5">
		<text>I heard about a faction, called «The Last Day». People say it consists of crazy stalkers who lived in Foggy Swamps. They believed that all this would come to an end soon. No, not the end of the Zone. The end of everything - our whole world. They were also studying the dead, dunno why though. They didn't have any allies, but had plenty of enemies. It's now wonder that no one heard from them for a long time already. But who knows, maybe they're still sitting in that swamp, hiding.</text>

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_6">
		<text>Do you know Semenov, the ecologist from Yantar? I heard that he got a unique Beretta that can outperform any other pistol. Semenov says that he upgraded it himself, worked on it for a couple of months. But I don't believe that - they're scientists, not mechanics!</text>

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_7">
		<text>I heard that around a year ago a foreigner appeared in the Zone. He came with some crowbar in his hand and asked many questions.

		<text>I heard that in the past soldiers here used special AKS-74U with integrated silencers. Maybe for night-time operations, I dunno. Though, I didn't see a single one of those guns around. Traders don't sell them, dead don't have them, couldn't even find one in a stash...</text>

Well, they managed to stuff those grenades inside, made a testing shot - and the explosion was so big that they were scattered across five meter radius. The grenade launcher exploded right in their hands. That's why you don't try to modify something unless you know how it works...</text>

		<text>Do you know something about Borov? The one who was leader of bandits some time ago. I heard he had a unique gun - a personal Walther P99.

Ha!</text>

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_16">
		<text>I heard that a unique «Vintorez» was found somewhere around Radar. It was a personal weapon, actually, and had a name on it - "Sergei Quiet".

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_18">

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_19">
		<text>There was a stalker called Kid. He was really small and thin. I have no idea why did he even go into the Zone. But he had a very unusual rifle. He took SVU and modified it as he wanted, making it lighter and adding recoil compensator. I don't know what happened to him, but someone has seen his rifle in freedomer's hands. Maybe he joined them, maybe sold it, maybe... they took it from his body.</text>

		<text>Do you know about Gauss rifles? I only heard about them, but what's interesting: to create batteries for the gun, the «Flash» artefact is using, and some monolithians are creating new type of batteries, using the «Battery» artefact.

		<text>A friend of mine told me about an anomaly, that doesn't even have a name. He said it looks like a light-distorting hemisphere that flies from one place to another... He told me that you can only find this anomaly somewhere deep inside the Zone. Though how the hell can he know that - he never was there...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_24">
		<text>I heard there's an anomaly called «Amoeba». You can't see it until you step right on it. When you step on it - a jellyfish-like thing will jump from below the ground and float in the air. If it'll touch you - say goodbye. This «Amoeba» is fully covered in some kind of acid that can dissolve any suits with ease. You can find this anomaly in a forest or a swamp. So if you ever decide to visit a grassy place - remember to throw bolts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_25">
		<text>I heard about a rare anomaly called «Witches' jelly». They say that this isn't just an anomaly, but an artificial one, created even before the Second disaster. It looks a lot like "Fruit punch" - a green shining puddle. But it's actually a fungus that spreads across your whole body, disintegrating all tissues on contact. So if you ever touch this anomaly - immediately cut off the limb that made contact. Or else you will become a part of that puddle.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_26">
		<text>Ecologists have told me about an interesting anomaly - «Mosquito bald». It works like a gravitational field that changes the direction of objects inside it. If you throw a bolt inside - it will fly out from the side. But if a living thing happens to enter the anomaly range - it'll be torn to pieces.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_27">
		<text>Some guy told me... There's a very rare anomaly - «Dead zone». Nor your eyes, nor detector can see it. Radiation inside that zone is even worse than at the Radar, and all devices stop working near it. If somebody enters it - he'll either die instantly or in 2-3 days. The scariest part is - they'll just drop dead, like from a heart attack. The body organs are fine, no punctures, not even scratches. The living will just become the dead.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_28">
		<text>Did you know that the «Mama beads» artefact wasn't formed in thermal anomalies before? I heard that there was an anomaly called the «Time machine». The anomaly itself is harmless, but time inside it feels like it goes way slower. If you get inside it - you'll have to spend a lot of time getting out. And right in the centre of it the «Mama beads» were formed. And what's interesting, the moment you grab the artefact - anomaly disappears, like it was never there...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_29">
		<text>You know, «Electras» are nothing. I heard about more interesting electrical anomaly - «Meat grinder». Sparkles flying in the air, ground discharging. The anomaly builds up a charge of electricity inside itself, doesn't react to any objects, but when a living thing happen to enter it's range - a discharge strikes from the centre of it, twisting and tearing the body apart. And after that, the anomaly becomes harmless for some time, until it'll recharge completely.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_30">
		<text>You saw the «Burnt fuzz» already, right? Did you know, that there's a similar anomaly? It's called «Rusty hair». It's kind of mutated lichen than hangs down the roofs and ceilings. But, contrary to «Burnt fuzz», this lichen doesn't care if you walk past it at slow or high speed - if you touch it, you'll instantly get strong burn. And that's not the end of it. If something touches the «Rusty hair», it's vines will spread out, trying to catch as much objects as possible. Not bad for a linchen, eh?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_31">
		<text>Did you know, that «Comets» worked a bit differently before? They were called «Torrids» then. You couldn't see them like you can now. Instead of fireball there was just a steam flying. If you throw something in that steam - it turns into flames. And what's interesting: the temperature of the flames were lower than it is now, which means you could get away with just a burn. And if you get hit by «Comet» now - you become dead. Maybe the radiation changed it somehow, maybe something else...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_32">
		<text>Recently I heard about a strange anomaly - the «Grabber». It looks like some sort of a plant, laying in bushes, almost invisible. If you step on it - it'll slam shut, catching you inside. And if you get trapped there - say goodbye, you'll get dissolved like a fly. But if you walk through it slowly, like you do with «Burnt fuzz», the anomaly won't react at all. So if you ever go into a grassy place - remember to look where you step.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_33">
		<text>I heard that there was an anomaly before - «Black thorn». It looked like a lot of black needles in the ground, if you touch them - they'll shoot themselves towards you, piercing even strong vests. And for the scariest part - if it hits an animal or a human, more needles will grow from it's flesh, tearing through the skin. I dunno why is it not present anymore, tho I heard some stalkers found a way to get rid of it completely. Any way, good thing that it's gone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_34">
		<text>I heard that the «Black thorn» anomaly was spread everywhere across the Zone. It looked like a bunch of black needles, growing from the ground. I don't know, how stalkers managed to get rid of it, but that's a good thing. If it would still be present, I would stay in Cordon forever.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_35">
		<text>Do you know about the «Soap bubble» anomaly? Well, imagine a semi-transparent sphere, floating in the air. And if something touches this sphere - it'll burst with a tremendous power. And if a human happens to touch it - well, in the best case, he'll be a cripple for the rest of his life.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_36">
		<text>I heard about an anomaly called «Howl». This anomaly strikes at your psy health: you'll start hearing a wolves howling around, and the longer you stay in that anomaly, the more wolves start to howl. All of this will cause you to feel very strong panic, it might even make you crazy. So if you ever hear a dog start howling - you better leave the place immediately.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_37">
		<text>I met a strange thing some time ago - something like orange fog. I was with a companion then, he thought it was just evaporations - the thing took place in the swamps. My companion made a step inside it and suddenly stopped. I pat his shoulder, and he looks at me with such anger. I saw him grabbing his rifle, so I pulled him from the fog - he passed out immediately. When he came to his senses, he told me, that once he stepped inside the fog - everything became orange and hateful. And when he saw me - hatred filled him so much, he wanted to kill me. When we got back to the camp, we asked some veterans about it, and they told us that it was an anomaly - «Crazy gas». Good thing I was able to save my partner, or else one of us would end up dead right there. And even worse - both of us.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_38">
		<text>An experienced stalker told me about an interesting anomaly - «Masher». It looks like a semi-transparent balls slowly floating in the air. And if something gets underheath them - it gets squished like under a press. I don't want to think what would happen with a person if he would get under this "ball".</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_39">
		<text>Do you know about the stalker named Kid? He was a short and thin guy. I heard that he was a true master, he could modify any rifle to make it better. Well... He died in an anomaly some time ago. In the «Slaughterhouse». Shame, he was such a pro at his job...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_40">
		<text>There's an anomaly called «Slaughterhouse». It doesn't look special, just a weird shadow on the ground. If you step inside it - it will squeeze your lungs when you'll try to breathe in. It's like the air is way too heavy, or the other way around. Yeah...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_41">
		<text>I heard about an anomaly called «Goo». It looks like a brown bubbling puddle. Or like a boiling mud. If something falls in it - the puddle will foam up and splash out a five-meter column of brown dirt in the air. This dirt will then fall down on the ground, melting everything, even rocks. After the dirt falls down, it evaporates into toxic gas, so you don't want to get near it without a mask. The best way to deal with this anomaly is to walk around it at safe distance. And don't even think of throwing something into the puddle, unless you want to become a melted corpse.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_42">
		<text>Once, I went on a raid with my friend. We found a strange field that wasn't even marked on the map. Well, we were very young then, so we decided to try walking through it. The further we went, the more sleepy we became. I realised that something was off, so I shook my friend on the shoulder and ran. He understood and ran after me. I almost fell down from the tiredness, but we were able to get out. When we got out, we felt such a thirst that we almost drank all the water we had. Later, I asked an experienced stalker about that field. He told me that this field - is an anomaly, called «Poppy field». It will make you sleepy, and if you fall asleep - you won't wake up, ever. I think it's obvious that we never went there again.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_43">
		<text>I heard about a very scary anomaly, called the «Web». It looks like a very thin strings between the trees - you won't notice them unless you use a flashlight to light them up. Detector will only react to it when you get very close to the string, so if you won't be walking slow - you won't be able to react in time. The string itself is very thin and very sharp, even sharper than the knife. It will cut through any vest like through butter, so you can imagine what will happen to the bare flesh. But what's strange: the moment string starts to cut through flesh - it gets torn apart, leaving only big bleeding wounds behind.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_44">
		<text>I was once exploring the old houses that are scattered around - almost got into a strange anomaly. That house looked just like the rest, but one of the walls was completely ruined. And everything that would get inside the house would fly out that broken wall at huge speed. Good thing I have a habit of throwing bolts in front of me. Or else I would end up flying out. I later asked a friends of mine about that thing. They told me that it was an anomaly called "Vacuum cleaner". They said it can not only push you out, but also suck you in with huge strength, squishing human like a sponge. So remember to throw bolts, mate.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_45">
		<text>I heard about a place where veterans love to scary rookies. That place has a unique anomaly in it - the «Stomper». This anomaly is completely invisible, but as you enter it you immediately hear some kind of stomping in the distance. The more time you spend inside, the closer the stomping grows. And when it gets very very close - it suddenly disappears, leaving only silence behind. Experienced stalkers love to take rookies to that place - to laugh as newbies are scared to death, trying to find the source of the sound. But recently one of the rookies got so scared, he pulled out his gun and shot in the distance few times, hitting one of the stalkers in the arm. Since then stalkers have stopped toying with rookies at that place.</text>

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_46">
		<text>I heard very creepy story... A stalker called Stagger went on a deep raid with his group. An emission passed, and after a day Stagger returned to camp alone. Though, he didn't talk to anyone and acted weirdly. Some people thought that he got zombified. But he looked completely normal. He just arrived at the camp, walked around a bit and left, not saying a word. One hour later, his group arrived. Stalkers asked them, why did they split up with the Stagger, which got the group very surprised. They said that Stagger died in an emission two days ago, they buried him. Everyone got shocked. Everyone, excluding the one old stalker that was in the Zone since the first days. He said that it's a very rare anomaly - if a stalker happens to die during an emission, his "twin" will appear somewhere in the Zone. This "copy" will then wander across the Zone, and usually it dies in a short time due to some anomaly. Though, the old man didn't know the name for that anomaly, so stalkers decided to name it «Stagger», in the memory of the stalker. Yeah...</text>

		<text>Did you know that a three specially smart controllers lived at the Country Road that is now occupied by the military? They could control all mutants in area, sending them to attack the army block post. Military got tired of it, so they sent a group to deal with one of the controllers. It angered the other two so much that they sent all the mutants that were under their control to attack block post at once. And oh boy, it was such a massacre, probably the biggest in the Zone history. But it seems that military managed to defend themselves. I mean, they're still occupying that road, right?</text>

The lab is hidden somewhere on the territory of Red Forest, but the exact location isn't mentioned, and so far no one could find an entrance. I was able to take a peek at the documents, and from the look of things, the scientists were experimenting on building up brain mass.

Someone even found a body of a stalker, that had notes about that lab on his PDA - from the look of things, he was inside it. In his notes he stated that there was an unusual mutant living inside the lab - something like a brain mass. It created an illusion that lab was completely fine, like it was cleaned every day by someone. This mutant could also control people. Stalker noted that this "mass" contacted him and asked to build some kind of cart so that this mass could get outside. It seems like stalker ran out of the lab, but mutant was able to get into his brain - when they found stalker's body, he was laying with a hole in his head and a pistol in hand. The sad thing is, stalker didn't note the coordinates of the lab entrance. Though, maybe it's for the better.</text>

He entered it and found some stuff laying around, like if someoen  lived there: backpack and old rifle laying together, many maps on the wall, bed and some other things. He looked around and continued on walking. Behind the church there was a coast with small wooden boat. On his right - small wooden fence.

		<text>Once, the ecologists gave a task for group of six stalkers to catch three karlicks that were stealing stuff from the bunker. Stalkers were thinking of killing the mutants, but eggheads insisted on getting them alive, for studying purposes. Stalker group approached karlick's lair, it was some kind of old farm. Stalkers went inside to look around. That place, indeed, contained many stolen things, but all of them were untouched, not a single box was opened and not a single package was torn. Suddenly they heard a laugh behind them. Stalkers turn around and see three karlicks standing in doorway and laughing. And as sudden as they appeared, they ran each in different direction. Stalkers ran after them, splitting up with two men for each karlick. They used walkie-talkies to coordinate their movement, so that they can chase all three karlicks into a single spot. And it felt like karlicks did the same thing - they saw through every trick and traps that stalkers were trying to pull off. Stalkers got tired of this shit, one of them sped up and caught the karlick. Suddenly, karlick puts his hands on stalker's head, making him scream at the top of his lungs. Everyone got scared and opened fire at the mutants. As a result, ecologists received three dead karlicks. They did save that one stalker, he said that the mutant tried to get into his head.

He carefully approached the wounded, when stalker says: "Everyone is dead... Help me, please. I won't be able to stand up by myself". Well, veteran approached him, raised him on his shoulder and left the place. He walks back to camp when wounded says: "Look, a house... let's rest there for a bit". Stalker didn't like the idea, but he was tired, so he walked towards the house. He only made a few steps inside, when the door suddenly closed. Stalker immediatly threw the wounded on the bed, pulled out his gun and turned around. A weird mutant, straight from the nightmares, jumped towards him. It looked like a naked humanoid monster with ugly face and some kind of bat wings. Mutant raised it's arm, stalker aimed his gun - when suddenly a wounded guy pulls him by his leg. Stalker fell down, but still pressed the trigger. He got lucky and hit it dead. Stalker turned to the wounded - he was completely dead. Later, stalker found out that this mutant is called mimicry.

And what's interesting: they had some kind of intelligence. They made clothes for themselves and used guns. They could even use grenades. In general - very dangerous mutant.

		<text>Dutyers told me that Dead City was full of zombies before. And not just zombies, but some weird ones, with parasites that took over their heads. Those parasytes spread their spores in the air, and if those spores get inside a human or a dog, they would multiply inside the body until they grow up so big that they can eat the brain. After that they "hatch" through the head, releasing tentacles in the body. That way they can control their preys. And Dead City was really infested with those parasites. Good thing that Duty was able to stop them from spreading. It would be a real apocalypse if they didn't. I think Freedom noticed that city was cleared and moved in then.</text>

They also had a pseudogiant trapped on the lowest floor - they were scared of him so much, they caught stalkers, stunned them and threw them to him. The "soldiers" themselves weren't intelligent, they were more like a zombies, but I heard that some of them could talk. Stalkers named them pseudohumans. Yep. They all are dead now, probably.

		<text>I heard that there was a strange mutant living in the lake near Dead City, stalkers called it «Sentient lake». It looked like a very ugly giant crab. This mutant sat in that lake and controlled all the mutants around. And not just mutants - it could even control stalkers, if they would get too close. It created a lot of problems for the ecologists. They got tired of it and created some sort of device that would imitate the work of zombie's brain. They hired freedomers to grab this device and go to the lake. Freedomers mined whole place, retreated and blew it up.

As they were shooting off the mutants, they found an underground passage there. They went inside. As they walk through dark corridor, they suddenly feel a very strong ringing in their ears. Stalker opens his eyes and sees only darkness. He heard a muffled voice mumble something in th distance. He had no other choice but to follow the voice. As he walks towards the voice, it grows louder and more audible. The voice was saying fragments of phrases. Stalker turned around the corner and saw light. As he entered it, he found himself on a street. He looked closer and realised that it was Lenin's square. The he saw few stalkers staying underneath the monument, their backs turned at him.  Suddenly, they all turned around, and as the voice grew more evil, they raised their guns. Stalker had no choice but to shoot. As he got closer to their bodies, he realised that those were his companions. Looks like this emitter zombified them somehow. Stalker grieved for a moment, gathered his strength and continued on. He entered a building and walked through a very long corridor with many closed doors. One of the doors was open, stalker entered it. As he entered the room, he saw a strange scary mutant inside the big incubator, surrounded by phantoms. Stalker's vision started getting darker by a moment, but he didn't fall - he grabbed his grenade and threw it tat the monster. Good thing that he was able to hind behind the table. Grenade went off and stalker felt his head getting lighter as the "emitter" died. He took a look around, wandered across the underground, grabbed some stuff and returned to the ecologists. They paid him well, but he didn't do any business with them after that. I can understand him...</text>

As they turned it on, the words flashed on the screen: "Consciousness can't be found. Please, plug in working objects".

They entered it and saw a bloodsucker sleeping while standing, like they always do, but he was also pressing something to his chest. Stalkers didn't want to give mutant any chance, so they just shot him dead. Then they came closer to see what he was holding. It was a child's painting. They looked around and saw many other paintings like that. And all paintings contain a family. Ever since then, stalkers believe that humanoid mutants have some memory about their past life still left in them. That's kinda sad, to be honest.

Hunter ran after him, but tripped and dislocated his shoulder. He couldn't fight like this, so he returned to the camp. After a few days as his shoulder got fixed, he went on a hunt once again. This time he paid attention to every sound, his rifle ready. He followed the same trail, and suddenly he heard a noise behind him. Stalker turns around, raises his gun, but realised it was just a stone falling down. But why did the stone just fall? Hunter realised that something was off. He turns back and sees a bloodsucker flying towards him. Stalker jumps to the side, mutant flies past him. He shot and this time he got it good. He took his trophy and return to camp, where he told everyone what happened. Everyone got surprised - are mutants capable of such tricks? Ever since, hunters prefer to complete their hunt in one go.

Suddenly, from one of the classrooms, a weird, dunno how to call it, child's figure comes out. It looked like a child's shadow, and it just stood there. Stalkers couldn't move a muscle. This shadow looked like a small girl in a school uniform. This "girl" grabbed a toy from the floor and suddenly threw it at the stalkers. They got scared and ran outside. They never returned to that place again. Though, I think it all was just their imagination. What "shadows"? That school is a big psy-zone, no wonder that they saw things. And about the flying toy - it was probably a poltergeist or a burer. They love throwing stuff.</text>

		<text>I heard that bandits had a "shooting range". They captured crows and used them as targets. You would pay, they would release the crows and let you shoot them. For each shot crow they would pay you, and they only gave a limited time to shoot. But the thing is, you would use your own gun, and your own ammo. It just wasn't worth it at all - you would waste more money on ammo than you'd get. Only a few stalkers could make profit from it. Many couldn't even return the money they paid in the start. It was basically a scam.</text>

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_102">
		<text>I heard that there is an unusual type of pseudodogs - «Chernobyl dogs». It's something in-between of normal pseudodog and a psy-dog. If a human would look into that dog's eyes, he'd be blinded for a moment. And it's howl would disorientate anyone around. Dangerous beasts.</text>

		<text>Did you know that the biggest snorks lair was in the Agroprom? I heard that dutyers hired a skilled mercenary to get down there and flood the largest part of it. I don't know how did he manage to complete the job, but he did it. That part of the undergrounds got pumped out recently, so it's open for exploration. But I won't recommend going down there. I heard that some mutants are living there again.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_105">
		<text>I heard that snorks were smarter before. They could use sticks to fight, and even use their old guns. No, they didn't shoot, they just used them as clubs. I'm not sure if it's good or bad that they're more stupid now...</text>

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_106">
		<text>Did you know that there are different types of bloodsuckers? For example, there's underground bloodsuckers that are a bit smaller and have darker skin. There's also swamp bloodsuckers, also known as swamp things - their skin is more greenish and thicker. On top of that, they can jump very far. I saw it myself as one of these mutants jumped out of the bushes, grabbed a stalker and then jumped away with him. Scary...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_107">
		<text>Have you ever heard about the «Night King»? It was a very dangerous bloodsucker that lived somewhere deep in the Zone. Hunters that killed it told me that it would ignore any bullets - like it was invulnerable. It killed half of their group before one of the hunters shot it with under-barrel grenade launcher. Only then the bloodsucker got blown to pieces. And what's interesting - they found a «Night star» artefact inside him. Maybe he swallowed it, maybe it was somehow implanted inside him, but it seems that the artefact was the reason why the bloodsucker didn't care about the bullets.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_108">
		<text>I heard a story that after military cleared out X-18, they sent a small squad to check the surroundings. It was peaceful at first, before soldiers approached a small storehouse that was behind the main building. They entered it and froze - there were around 18 bloodsuckers! And all of them were just standing there, sleeping... Soldiers almost shot at them, but they hold their fire. They acted smart: mined the storehouse and put a machine gun at the distance. When everything was ready - they blew up the explosives and opened fire to kill anyone who survived the explosion. They killed every last of these sucking mutants without any casualties. So, be careful when exploring buildings - who knows, maybe you've stumbled upon bloodsucker's sleepover.</text>

		<text>One stalker in the camp told me a story. He was walking around Zaton, exploring the terrain. Then he saw a cave. He approached it carefully - who knows, maybe it's mutant lair. Suddenly, he heard a voice saying: "Leave here, man...". And the voice was right inside his head. Stalker left the place immediately. Some time later he found out from the Trapper that there was a controller living in that cave, but another stalker already took care of him. Creepy stuff...</text>

		<text>One old stalker told me that poltergeists didn't explode on death before. Instead, they would materialize, showing their physical body. Their body distantly resembled human, but it was weirdly changed. Their shoulders were wider, they didn't have legs at all, their head looked like alien's and they didn't have neck. You can believe it or not, but I think that it might be true. The Zone is constantly changing - mutants are changing too. So I think I'll believe that old man.</text>

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_111">

		<text>I heard that poltergeists were "unstable" before. They would suddenly change into their physical form for a short period, becoming more vulnerable. It seems that they mutated to become more stable like they are now. But some stalkers say that those are "newborn" poltergeists that haven't learn how to sustain their intangible form yet. Who knows...</text>

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_114">
		<text>I heard that there's a type of poltergeists that can become completely invisible. They are floating in the air too, but they're not throwing any items. Instead, they would fly at you and hit you. The only way to see them would be by barely noticeable distortion in the air and their quiet mumbling. Also you can use detector to see them on the screen. I don't know where do they live, but I haven't met one yet.</text>

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_115">
		<text>I heard a very creepy thing. Stalkers were exploring an underground somewhere deep in the Zone. They met an unusually powerful poltergeist there. It not only threw things at them, but also created fire pillars, just like pyrogeists do, and it also struck them with lightning bolts. Half of the squad was killed very fast. And it weren't the only things he could do. It could also create illusions. And when stalkers shot at those illusions, they would split into more. Stalkers were able to figure out which one of them was the real one and killed him. They have never returned to that underground again. And the knocking noise that the poltergeist was making still haunts them in their dreams.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_116">
		<text>A creepy story I've heard. Group of stalkers got a SOS signal. They arrived at the spot and saw an abandoned factory. They carefully entered it and saw a bunch of corpses and a dead poltergeist. They looked around to find the survivor. One of the stalkers approaches mutant's body to get his trophy. Suddenly - the polter fucking punches him! Stalker fell down and didn't get up anymore. Averyone panicked, while the poltergeists began to crawl towards them. Their heads started to hurt while the items on the ground began to fly towards them. And not just items - poltergeist even threw bodies at them. Stalkers opened fire and killed the mutant before he would kill them all. Though, they still lost one more guy - polter hit his head with a wooden box. So... be careful when you decide to check the SOS signal location...</text>

		<text>There's a rare mutant called «illusionist». It's a humanoid mutant that is very thin, his head is big and ugly, and it's so heavy that it hangs down onto his chest. And because of that, many stalkers think that the top of his head is his face. The mutant wears an old black coat. And this mutant will attack only in defence. It's ration is mushrooms juice and carrion. And the name comes from it's ability to create scary illusions if someone gets too close to it's lair.</text>

		<text>Have you ever heard how dutyers were hunting a rare mutant for the ecologists? Well, the rare mutant, called «illusionist», set it's lair inside an abandoned factory, maybe it was «Rostok», I don't know. Eggheads wanted samples of this mutant for their research so they hired a Duty squad. Dutyers gathered their things and went to the factory. People say that the shooting was so loud that no one could sleep. And when everything went silent, the survived dutyers left the factory in hurry. Some of them were dragging mutant's body on a tarp, while others were carrying their dead comrades. When stalkers inspected the factory later, it looked like a battle field. Wreckage lying around, part of the roof fell. Piles of bullet casings laying around like in a shooting range. Blood, pieces of flesh everywhere. A bloody mess. I doubt that the job was worth it. Dutyers lost many good guys then.</text>

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_119">
		<text>Can you imagine - some stalkers were able to tame a mutant! I heard about three such cases. Once, soldiers at the Cordon tamed a blind dog, they called him Bobic. There's also one crazy stalker at Zaton that was able to tame a pseudodog, he called it Lassie. And, of course, I should bring the legendary Doctor and his pseudodog, tho I don't know how does he call it. How did they manage to find a common language with the beasts?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_120">
		<text>Have you heard about the legendary Doctor? I bet you've heard. Anyways, I heard that he tamed a pseudodog. But we know that pseudodogs originated from wolves, and Doctor's dog looks like a mutated bulldog. So maybe it's not a pseudodog after all...</text>

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_121">
		<text>I heard a story about one stalker that wanted to collect artefacts at Radar. But we all know how much radiation is there, and the stalker was short on money. Well, he took his «Sunrise» suit and modified it. He attached two air balloons to it's back and changed the inner material to increase psy-protection. He called his creation a «Hermosuit» and went on his journey to Radar. Some time later, stalkers found his body between the abandoned cars that was radioactive as fuck. So here's a moral of the story - don't try to make something yourself if your hands aren't good enough. Better to save up some money and buy yourself a good suit instead. Or else you'll end up just like him.</text>

		<text>I heard a story that two soldiers once decided to steal couple of vests and sell them later. Well, they were able to stole two vests from the storage and hid them in the cellar. But two weeks later, someone sneaked into the block post during the night and stole bunch of things, including some important documents. And, of course, he also stole the two vests that were hidden. Commander ordered to recalculate their inventory to know what exactly is missing. And the thing is - the storage was locked for good, and our night thief wasn't able to get inside, but somehow they were two vests short. Commander started to shout at everyone and interrogate them one by one. Well, they found out who stole the vests, and those two soldiers got punished hard. Ye, funny story.</text>

		<text>Did you know that anomalies can change items in some weird ways? For example, if a suit happens to fall into an anomaly without being turned into useless crap instantly, it may gain a very useful properties after some time. For example, stalkers found an unusual «Sunrise» suit inside the whirligig anomaly. This suit could repel bullets. No, it wouldn't save you if you'd get shot right in the chest, but if the bullet would fly towards your, let's say, arm, or shoulder, or kidney, it would get repelled. Stalkers named that suit «Enchanted Sunrise». Tho it's unclear how to throw a suit into an anomaly to get the needed effect.</text>

		<text>Have you heard about the operation «Monolith»? The one where military were storming the CNPP after Strelok turned off the Brain Scorcher. I heard that the commander of the operation had an unusual armoured suit - a modified SKAT-9. The thing about that suit is that it uses the super-modern titan alloy, making the suit way lighter while keeping the same level of protection. Most likely, the suit is still laying near the CNPP.</text>

		<text>Take my advice - do not trust Sidorovich. Yes, he's authoritative trader, but shit as a person. He sent many rookies in anomalies to get artefacts for him. Well, of course most rookies make it out alive, but still. He doesn't care about anything but money.</text>

		<text>Did you know that Wolf had box of dynamite before? I don't know, why would he need it, but after some time that he got it, dutyers launched an attack at Freedom's base by blowing up one of the walls.

		<text>I heard a story from Wolf, that once a rookie got robbed by bandits somewhere at the Cordon, they also took his gun. That rookie was very angry for a while, then he somehow got himself an AK and ran to the ATP to get his revenge. The shooting started and ended in a couple of minutes. No one saw that rookie since then. Moral of the story - do not overestimate your powers, and don't seek stupid revenge.</text>

		<text>You know that dutyers like to test those who wish to join them, right? I heard that there was a sergeant named Plichko, he liked to come up with weird tasks. Once, he ordered a rookie to get inside the abandoned hangar territory and check if there's any documentation left. The thing is, that hangar was full of «Burnt Fuzz», and the only way to entry was through the roof. Well, the rookie really wanted to be a Duty member, so he went on to do the job. Day has passed - he didn't return. Well, Plichko sent two dutyers to go and check what happened - maybe the stalker found something valuable and ran. Dutyers climbed on top of the hangar and saw large hole in it's roof. They look down - a piece of roof is laying on the ground, and stalker's body is hanging in the «Burnt Fuzz» with horror written on his face. Dutyers got terrified of such death, they reported the incident to the higher ranking officers. It wasn't the first time when Plichko sent a rookie to his death, so he lost his rank. And that is that.</text>

		<text>Once a Freedom sniper started to shoot out the dutyers. He climbed on top of water tower not far away from bar «100 Rads» and shoot at every dutyer in sight. And every time someone closed in on him - he just disappeared. It was long before Duty moved their base closer to the bar. By doing that, sniper didn't let the dutyers that were sitting in the bar to return to their base. Dutyers hired an experienced stalker, he set an ambush on the sniper. It seems that freedomer didn't expect non-dutyer to kill him.</text>

		<text>Have you ever heard of a guy named Borov, the one who was bandit's leader before? Well, someone killed him, and many thought that it was because of conflict between bandits, but I heard something more interesting. Some people say that it was Voronin who paid a stalker who was working for them to kill Borov. It all happened because bandits catched a dutyer who was carrying documents about X-18 laboratory back to the base. Hired stalker made his way into bandit base without raising any suspicion, killed Borov, took the documents and fled to the Duty base. Voronin gave him rank of Duty veteran for that. Some people even say that it was Strelok himself, but I doubt that things like that would interest him.</text>

		<text>There was a sadistic bastard in Freedom ranks before, his name was Tyrant. They didn't kick him out because he was very skillful soldier. Once he was able to push his way into Wild Territory and capture the construction site with his squad. Dutyers spent a lot of time trying to kick him out of there, but they weren't successful. Then Voronin sent one experienced veteran to deal with it. And can you believe that - he sole handedly killed whole Tyrant's group, including him. After that Voronin promoted him to «Keeper of Duty» rank. Some people say that it was Strelok, but I don't believe that. Why would a loner help Duty?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_133">
		<text>One day, General Voronin, the leader of Duty, hired an experienced stalker to do a very important job - kill Lukash, the leader of Freedom. Stalker was meant to make his way into Freedom's base unnoticed, kill Lukash without making any noise and return with his PDA. But Freedomers aren't stupid - they know each other, and when they saw a freedomer that no one knew - they instantly realised what was going on. I don't know if the stalker ran away or died there - there's no information on that. But as we all know, Lukash is still alive and well.</text>
	</string>

		<text>In the past, Dutyers didn't let every stalker into Rostok Factory territory. They only let other dutyers pass, and those who had the permission. But... if there's a power, there's a corruption, right? Well, you could pass for one-two thousands of rubles, or if you would do something for them. For example, shoot mutant pack and bring the trophies. It's good that now you can pass freely. They really were acting more like bandits before.</text>

		<text>Some time ago, there was a group of killer veterans camping in Wild Territory. They robbed and killed loners that were passing by. Right under Duty's nose! And Voronin just ignored it - the leader of that group, Lucky, was the one who helped Duty to capture territory of the factory. But Voronin knew that this shit can't go on, so he hired one stalkekr through Barkeep to deal with it, so that if he won't be successful, no one would know that it was Duty who hired him. Stalker attacked Lucky's group at night and killed them all. Dutyers don't like to talk about that story - and I'm not surprised, who would like to admit that they were friends with maniacs.</text>

Professor Kruglov was on that helicopter and he carried very important information. The helicopter fell down, but Kruglov and few peopel survived. Mercs surrounded them and were ready to shoot them all, when a stalker appeared from behind and killed every last of them. Can you imagine? They say that stalker was Strelok himself. I won't be surprised if it's true - he's not called that for nothing.</text>

When stalkers found him, he was mumbling that he saw "it" and that "it" is now inside his head. He screamed that no one should go to the North. He talked about his daughter. Then he asked stalkers that found him to take the artefact he was holding and carry it to the Barkeep so that he would compensate something to his family. After stalkers took the artefact, Falcon suddenly ran straight into «Meatgrinder». Looks like Scorcher "burned" him after all. Sad story, he was a good stalker.</text>

		<text>Dutyers have a weird habit to order the killing of their enemies from loners. For example, general Voronin once ordered Leshiy, the Freedom's guide. And what do we see today? Leshiy is alive and well. Not all loners are skilled. But dutyers can't hire mercs for that - they're at war with each other. Question - why won't they just send their own guy? That's because freedomer can feel a dutyer from a mile away.</text>

Everything went smooth and clean, and no one in Duty even flinched - they would be happy to get rid of him themselves if they would have a good reason to do so.

Once he was sent together with group of guys to scout the area deep in the Zone. When the group returned, Banana wasn't with them. They got in a shootout with monolithians, few of them died. And right in the middle of the fight - a blowout happened. They ran towards the house that was nearby, all survivors were able to hide there. All, but Banana.

After Brain Scorcher was turned off, few years passed and Leshka went on his journey to the centre of the Zone, while Sevka stayed. Few days passed and then Brain Scorcher starts working again out of nowhere. Sevka got worried about his friend, so he started preparing for trip to the North. I don't know how he managed to pull it off, but he arrived at Zaton in one piece. There he met his friend - standing with other zombified stalkers. Tragic end. Sevka grieved for long time, he thought it was his fault. He hid his zombified friend in the cave and tied so that he wouldn't escape. When Brain Scorcher was turned off again - he hit the road to find the Wish granter. He said he wanted to make a wish to make Leshka human again. He was very naive.

		<text>Did you know that Farmstead at the Army Warehouses is used to close deals? Stalkers often use that spot for meetings because it's a quiet and convenient spot. Though one time bandits decided to camp there and rob those who were carrying any type of goods. Well, Barkeep hired some goons, they kicked bandits out of there. I don't know what exactly did they do to those thugs, but they have never returned to the spot.</text>

		<text>Have you ever heard about major Khaletskiy? He was a tough soldier and a bastard. He hated stalker so much, he sold information about their travel routes to bandits. One time he sold two stalkers to slavery! Can you imagine? After he attacked Sidorovich's couriers and stole a case they had, stalkers got tired of it so they set up an ambush. When they caught him, they put him behind the bars in the Farm at the Cordon. They interrogated him again and again, where is the case - he never told them because he knew that his subordinates were going to free him. And he was right, military were planning a rescue operation, they even captured Vehicle station and set their base there. But stalkers hired an experienced mercenary to help them deal with the soldiers. After that Khaletskiy realised that no one will rescue him, so he gave up the coordinates of stash where he hid the case. Next day he disappeared. He killed two guards and ran. Everyone got suspicious of third guard and the mercenary - everyone knows mercs like to work for both sides to get paid more. Ever since, no one saw Khaletskiy again. But there were some weird soldiers that were wandering around Cordon - some people say those were Khaletskiy's agents, they were looking up for some information, maybe major wanted to take revenge...</text>

		<text>I heard that one stalker tried to sneak inside the military roadblock at Cordon. He managed to get inside, go up to second floor and steal the PDA with information, but they caught him on his way back. When they interrogated him, he said that he was hired by a group of stalkers in Rookie village, he didn't know their names. Sidorovich had to pay a good price to stop military from raiding the village.</text>

		<text>I heard that a group of stalkers appeared in Rookie village, no one knew anything about them. They sat there for few days, talked to few guys. Then someone tried to sneak inside the military roadblock but got caught, and the group of stalkers just vanished. It seems that they were looking for someone to do their job for them, but it didn't work out.</text>

		<text>Have you ever heard of a stalker named Amit? I heard that he could get any information you want. One time he was getting information about some rifle upgrades for Aydar, the technician that was working in Agroprom some time ago. When he was carrying the information back to the technician, he climbed up a tower for some reason and died there, either from radiation or anomalies. It remains a mystery why did he climb there. Maybe he thought he saw something like artefact or a stash up there. Who knows...</text>

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_161">
		<text>There was a stalker called Losev. Don't ask me why was he called like that, I don't know. He was interested in Zone creatures, but no, he wasn't a hunter. He studied the behaviour of the mutants and wrote everything in his PDA. He had very good knowledge of any mutant kind, if you needed - he could tell you their weak points and habits. He had a theory that mutants are migrating from one corner of the Zone to other, just like normal animals. He recorded all cases of stalkers meeting with certain type of rare mutants. Once he noticed that mutants that he was tracking were vanishing somewhere between Great Swamps and Yantar. Then he decided to check Agroprom's Undergrounds to check if they had some sort of "transit point" there. He never returned. Later, when dutyers sent a mercenary down there to deal with some other mission, he found Losev's body and took his PDA. The PDA was full of migration maps of rare mutants - excluding north regions, of course. So even though Losev has died, his research was of great help for many stalkers.</text>

		<text>I heard that few years ago there was a pac of pseudodogs at the Garbage. They attacked diggers at night, tearing poor guys apart. Yeah, many stalkers died then. Wild Napr, leader of diggers, got tired of it so he hired a mercenary to deal with the dogs. Next night, another group gets attacked by the mutants, but merc arrived in time to kill the dogs before anyone got seriously hurt. Nine dogs! Can you imagine? Yeah, I'm not looking forward to meeting with those puppies in the wild...</text>

		<text>Did you know, that before Sidorovich, there was another trader sitting in that bunker? He was called Toad, and he was even worse than Sidorovich. He wasn't as fat, but his personality was ugly: he was rude to everyone, had no respect for stalkers. By the way, he only had one hand, and his legs were partly broken, making him unable to move very much. He always sat with a shotgun in his hand - maybe he felt at ease this way, or he just liked the gun. People say he used stalkers like expendable material, many rookies died because of him. He had a deal with military, just like Sidorovich does, so they weren't shooting at stalkers. But as the time went on, the relations between a group of stalkers and military worsened, a shootout happened. After that, military reinforced their posts and started to shoot those who came too close. Toad didn't appreciate that, it hurt his business, and the place weren't safe anymore, so he moved deeper into the Zone. But as far as I know, he died there. Maybe someone shot him, maybe he fell in anomaly. As I see it, Sidorovich realised that it was a good moment to make his own "trading empire", so he took Toad's place. He always knows how to make money.</text>

		<text>Have you ever heard of a stalker called Journalist? People say he was some kind of reporter before he got into the Zone. And what was his business here is unknown.

		<text>I heard about a stalker that was friends with zombies in Dead City. He fed them, they talked to him, well, at least they tried to. They told him about their lives before the Zone happened.

		<text>Ever heard of missing children in Pripyat? Some stalkers say that right before Second disaster happened, they were brought here. And those children never appeared again. Of course, most likely scenario is that they're... Well, you know. But there was one stalker that believed that those children are still here. No, not as zombies. That stalker, he was called Journalist, he believed that those children were hidden in the laboratories for experiments. Can you imagine? Experiments on children! I don't know if it's true or not, but that stalker suddenly vanished with no trace. If you think about it - maybe he dug too deep, and someone got rid of him... It's the Zone - everything might happen...</text>

		<text>One stalker who once was in Dead City, told me a very creepy story. When he was walking trough the city with his partner, they saw a huge crowd of zombies. No, not the zombified stalker, the "citizen" zombies. One of them was mumbling something. So they killed everyone except that one. They approached him, their guns pointed at his head. The zombie mumbles: "He... good... Journa... list... won't huuurt us...". Stalkers got confused and shot him. Interesting, isn't it?</text>

	<string id="st_phrase_companion_fact_168">
		<text>I heard that there was one mercenary, he was called Dog. He was very hard to kill. One time merc's base got swarmed by mutants, many people died. Dog survived. After some time, two stalkers attacked their base - Dog survived again. He was wounded, so he ran, and then emission happened. And even there he got lucky - he stumbled upon a blocked tunnel, where he hid. But then he ran out of luck - those two who attacked his base found him and finished him off. So yeah, luck won't always be on your side. So you better not rely on it too much.</text>

Well, he became delirious one day - he was talking about reprogramming the psy-emitter to control the mutants. Stalkers tried to reason with him, but he didn't listen, and one day he wandered off in the direction of Red Forest. He never return. What age does to a man...</text>

		<text>Some mercs told me that they were spied on by some stalker in Dead City. They noticed him by accident, he was sitting in one of the broken buildings. They gave signal to the sniper - he shot the guy. When they searched his body, they found a PDA with ton of information about their movement around the city. That stalker, as they found out, was called Vasiliy, and he had a contract to spy on their base. Who hired him - is unknown. What known is, he was meant to mit with his nephew Victor in the Cordon to give him the information. How the story developed - can't tell, but something tells me that they at least tried to find that Victor guy. Maybe even found him.</text>

		<text>I heard that there was a new guy in Rookie village, his name was Victor. His uncle called him in the Zone to give him something very important. Victor arrived at the meeting spot, but his uncle didn't. He wandered around, asked some people. THen he vanished - maybe he returned home, maybe the opposite - went deeper into the Zone. The thing is, a mercenary squad was noticed in Cordon at the same time, and when Victor disappeared - they disappeared too. Who knows, maybe they came after him.</text>

And one day Barkeep sent a stalker to get the documents from some abandoned building, and Jack decided to wait for stalker to leave the building and take the documents from him. But Jack overestimated his powers - stalker shot him as soon as Jack reached for the gun. Here's a lesson for ya: if you live like a dog - you die like a dog.</text>

		<text>You know about the Arena near the bar, right? I heard that they kept a madman there, they used him as "final boss". He was called The Beast, and I must say, when he fought he always went all out, like an animal. Plus, he was wearing an exoskeleton, so beating him wasn't an easy task. It went on, until he shot off dutyer's arm and they decided to put an end to this. Arnie, of course, wasn't happy about it, but he understood that keeping this "warrior" is even more dangerous than keeping a mutant.</text>

Kapets was wanted by Interpol for armed robberies, blackmail and rape. Rare scum. I don't know where are they now, but even other freedomers didn't like them - they tolerated them only because they were Lukash's old friends.

		<text>Have you ever heard about captain Maximenko that was leading military in Agroprom before? I heard that he was very strict, he was sending failing soldiers to the catacombs. Although, under his command they were able to find documents about laboratory X-18, which means his methods were effective enough. But even if he was a good commander, he was a bad person. One soldier fixed an old Zaporozhets - Maximenko sent him to the catacombs and took the car for himself. Funny enough, it led to his death - he was riding around the institute and crashed into bulldozer.</text>

		<text>You know that after Brain Scorcher was turned off, many stalkers moved North, right? Lesha Jaw was one of those guys, he was a stalker veteran. He led the group of seven people to the Radar. Lesha didn't like to take risks, so he sent two guys by the names of Crowbar and Log to approach Pripyat and scout the area. Time passed, they haven't returned. One of the group members, Treasurer, got tired of waiting so he fled. But the thing is, he carried the "gold reserve" of the group on his PDA. Lesha realised that it's not safe to move out yet, so he turned his group around and they left. Crowbar and Log were found dead near Pripyat later. And for the Treasurer - he was eaten by mutants not far away.</text>

		<text>One stalker told me this story. When he was a rookie, he and his friend found a spot with a lot of artefacts at the Garbage - the railroad tunnel. They went there several times and kept the place secret. As time went on, they noticed that bandits were wandering around more often. Then one time they had to hide in the tunnel so that bandits wouldn't see them. Suddenly, an emission happened, and the tunnel got filled with anomalies - stalkers were trapped. His friend decided to go deeper into the tunnel in order to find another exit, but he tripped and fell into anomaly. Other stalker sat near the old train, unsure what to do. Some time passed and another stalker was passing by the tunnel, he noticed him and helped him get out. After that, he returned to the Cordon and never went deeper into the Zone.</text>

I heard that he was constantly complaining about his service, but he always followed the orders and completed all missions assigned to him. This was the first and the last mission he couldn't complete - his whole group died, including him. When diggers found his PDA, it contained an audio recording with description of the operation. When soldiers were descending into the catacombs, they stumbled upon a few mutants living there. After dealing with them, they looked around for any documents, but were unsuccessful. They found nothing and tried to leave, but while they were underground - an emission occurred, and now the exit was blocked by anomaly. They tried looking for another exit, but instead they found a controller that killed them all.</text>

During one of his mission, his whole group was killed, but he managed to survive. He managed to get the evidence that htey were set up - they were sent on impossible mission intentionally. Polkan staged his death and joined loners to get his revenge by the "laws of the Zone". But he wasn't successful - military somehow realised that he survived and hired someone to finish him off. Sadly, the justice did not prevail.</text>

To be fair though, they didn't have time to make the place comfy - military arrived with a couple of BTRs.

And those stupid guys who stayed at the base - got shot.</text>

		<text>Some people say, that when mercenaries just arrived at their new base in Dead City, they got attacked by two stalkers. They killed half of mercs that were there from the distance, then stormed the building where survivors were hiding. Only 7 mercs were there when it happened, their squad was guarding the supplies. It seems that those two stalkers somehow knew when there will be least amount of people in the base, and then attacked. Some say that they were hired by someone to search for an artefact. What artefact - I don't know.</text>

		<text>This story I heard from Barkeep. One day, dutyers found a crazy stalker near the Radar. They brought him to the base, examined him for injures and started the interrogation. He didn't say a word. No, it's not like he was stubborn or something. His brains resembled a mush at that point - he was mumbling something non-stop, didn't react to anything. Then he said a name: Hunchback. Barkeep remembered that three stalkers visited the bar few days ago - Hunchback, Baldy and someone third. And Baldy was enjoying his drink in the bar right at that moment. Well, dutyers approached him, asked about his friends. He played dumb at first, but then he confessed - he, together with his friend Hunchback and Pock were sent on a mission to the Radar by ecologists. They were ready to depart, but they didn't have the information about Brain Scorcher periods of decline. Pock somehow managed to get that information and they moved out. As they were walking through the Radar, suddenly Brain Scorcher started to work at full. Pock grabbed his head and fell off the slope. Baldy wanted to ran away, but Hunchback insisted on saving their friend. Together they climbed down the slope, when suddenly Brain Scorcher hit them again. Baldy came to his senses when he already was sitting at the military base. He didn't know what happened to his friends. Baldy refused to talk with Pock, he felt guilty for leaving them. Dutyers returned to Pock, one of them pretended to be Baldy - when suddenly Pock got mad and started to blame him for his treachery and escape. Dutyer pretended that he wanted to return to the Radar and find Hunchback. Pock told him that he won't be coming, but he gave dutyer the flash drive with information about Brain Scorcher periods of decline. Suddenly, Pock grabbed his gun and blew his brains out. No one was able to stop him. Barkeep was angry that he had to clean the place, but the information they got from Pock was very useful for Duty.</text>

Stalkers had many problems because of him, but no one could shoot him down - he was a skilled veteran. Then stalkers got the idea to attack him at night - and they did so. But the sniper set up a wired trap at the entrance, and one of the stalkers blew himself up. Sniper woke up, a fight started, few more stalkers died, but they managed to kill the bastard.</text>

After Senior died, there were two claimants for his place - Lukash and Murk. Murk was Senior's successor and no one even questioned that he will take his place. But everything went on differently as you might have guessed. Murk had to leave the base for personal reasons, and Lukash used it to his advantage. Having his buddies back him up, he took Senior's spot, and what's funny enough, no one said a word. When Murk returned, he was unpleasantly surprised by his new commander. But he had no grounds to take Lukash's place, so he had no choice but to accept his new leadership.</text>

That Fang ordered some rare details from Black Digger, but he didn't like the price. Then he pretended to agree on the deal, and together they moved to Black Digger's hideout, then Fang killed him. After that he took the details he needed and ran off. How do I know all this? You see, when diggers noticed that Black Digger haven't been in a camp for a while, they scouted the area and finally found his secret hideout. There they found dead digger, and the hideout was a total mess, like if someone was searching for something. Then diggers asked stalkers about who they saw recently, and several stalkers said that they saw Fang in the camp. Then the rumours started, but no one was able to find Fang to confirm.</text>
