-Split existing patches for vanilla looting into: Boxes, Dynamic Item Spawn, Stashes, Task rewards. More awkward to use, but this was made so you can use the types you want while still avoiding the boxes patches as needed (as precaution is still required to use those).

Moving those the outfit mods to Fixes feels a bit weird, as I'm not completely replacing them, but at this point they're less patches than full reworks, so...
